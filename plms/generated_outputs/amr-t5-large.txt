Support resolutely the person who started the thread. I'll reply with a poem I've composed.
Pledge to fight to the death to defend the Diaoyu Islands and the related islands.
Fishing boats bumped into the fleet. Little evil Japanese ghosts stirred up trouble and unrest. With the heart of a thief and in the form of arrogance, they showed their wolfish appearance again.
Don't ever go back to that humiliating time when we signed the treaty. Be strong China! Sharpen the sword and shine the knife! Bury the approaching enemy!
September 11, 2010
I agree with the analysis of the thread starter. If the war really comes, I would like to be Hua Mulan to protect our home, defend our homeland, spread the prestige of China, and pledge to fight to the death for the defense of our national dignity.
I very much wish to be born during that passionate upsurge of Mao Zedong's Long March, to lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguish all the enemies who are wrong with China, and spread our dragon prestige.
How much tolerance do we have for Japan?
My fellow Citizens,
Hello everyone, We all know about the September 18th incident, but now again Japan has premeditated another sea incident like the Lugou Bridge.
Surprisingly, Japan defied the strong condemnation of the whole world, and invaded our sacred territory, the Diaoyu Islands, openly.
As we all know, the Diaoyu Islands have always belonged to China. Due to historical reasons, our original place of belonging has become a source of controversy.
My fellow Citizens, what is ours is ours and why is there a need to negotiate, Japan went even further, they wanted to create a fact of occupation, can we allow this? Absolutely not.
Fellow Citizens, Japan's militarism brought grave disasters to the Asian people.
For several long decades, especially China, suffered from the ravages of Japan.
Japan's Unit 731 experimented extremely brutal methods on the human body in the Northeast. The Nanjing Massacre added an ever-fading layer of blood to the ancient capital. Over a thousand kilometers, the bloody big battles in Hengyang and Changsha bared the bones of the dead, killing off everything.
To my fellow Citizens, there are too many instances of heinous crimes committed by Japan in China to cite, and the record is difficult to make due to the exhaustion of all the bamboo strips.
Just like those 10 million deceased souls who lost their lives wander over the Pacific Ocean and find it difficult to rest in peace.
All those who experienced that era must still vividly remember that era. Any time we turn and read these pages of history, even our younger generation cry with tears streaming down our cheeks, and our blood boils with indignation.
Now that Japan actually wants to reverse the verdict on its aggression history, fellow Chinese citizens and people in Asia are waking up to it.
Despite the pain of looking back on these 100 years of shame, we must go face to face with history. We must create and choose history, even though the issues of history remain unresolved.
Because it is responsible, we are not afraid. Even though the territory is small, it is related to matters of dignity. Regardless of how the wind and clouds change, the interests of the country and national unity guarantee honor. We cannot let our native land be separated, even though it is scarred by wounds.
As a fellow citizen of China, the advent of the 21st century means a time when we are beset by difficulties on the inside but pressed from the outside, and we face many challenges.
How should we go about the Taiwan issue, or the Tibet issue, or the South China Sea issue, or the surrounding environment, or the foreign forces that are aggressive towards China?
Fellow Citizens, what are you doing? Please look at the world map, the crescent-shaped encirclement suppresses our breath, strangles our development, and covets our national territory.
We don't want to make enemies, but we don't fear war, we don't want war.
We urgently have to arrange arms and strengthen all military forces on land, sea and air.
Although the Chinese nation has flourished for thousands of years, it has never before had the ambition to expand its territory outward.
We do not impose what we do not want on others, so we follow a foreign security strategy philosophy based on benevolence and virtue.
The tolerance and liberalness of the country is like the tolerance and liberalness of the individual, we have to insist that we don't get hurt in order to avoid hurting other people.
Tolerance is certainly not fear and sincerity does not have to be cowardice.
China's exemption of Japan from war reparations due to World War II serves benevolent peace.
My fellow Citizens, the People's Heroes Monument is a condensed history of a Chinese nation continually striving for improvement.
The magnificent solemn posture represents a sacred expectation of peace.
In my mind, many tragic, heroic scenes of shining spears and armored horses are sporadic agitating the string of my memories and thoughts.
The integrity thought goes through that yellow historical page as I see the famous emperor Kangxi contemplating in his audience hall how to achieve territorial unification hundreds of years ago, and also the former U.S. president Abraham Lincoln wandering alone in the dark of the great hall thinking about the integrity of the Union.
However, forgetting about war is certainly dangerous for peace in the world. My fellow citizens, if we want development and peace, we must never blindly exercise forbearance. In modern times, the Boxer Protocol of treachery and humiliation has aggravated China's poverty and backwardness. Falling behind leads to bullying.
Where does peace come from if there is no strength?
We must focus on national defense education, build up a great wall in the hearts of 13 billion people and establish a full range of national defense systems capable of attacking and defending.
For the best attack defense, we should strengthen forces that can engage in ultra-long range attacks, and improve combat capabilities in all aerospace over great distances and depths. Increase investment and construction in the defense industry, accelerate the modernization and internationalization of military equipment, establish high-tech elite divisions of high quality, on the premise of avoiding influence on economic development of the nation.
The battle horns are about to sound, people are already fully equipped and ready to go.
We accomplish nothing without people's support, but we are all the more powerful with their support.
My fellow Citizens, there are times when we say no to others. Therefore, we must achieve.
1. Establish a guarantee fund, improve the working environment and working mechanisms, and recruit back to China hundreds of thousands of information technology professionals who have emigrated from the United States and around the world and linger there.
2. Create a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
3. The manufacture of 5000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds.
4. Accelerate research and deployment of high-speed intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles that could break the missile defense system.
5. Resumption of nuclear experiments and establishment of a military force in space.
6) Retain 1000 nuclear bombs (equivalent to 10 million tons of TNT) and install nuclear warheads on all short and middle-range missiles when needed.
7 Retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines capable of inflicting three devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy.
8. Abandon your first commitment not to use nuclear weapons.
9 Preemptive strike rights are retained when national security is threatened.
My fellow citizens, only with confidence and improvement can we strive to be strong. Qin Shi Huang unifies China. Zheng Chenggong recovers Taiwan. Responsiblely, we must carry on the far-seeing, insight, and strong will of our predecessors.
Now that piece of land that trembles far from the embrace of the motherland shakes and moans and calls. Fellow Citizens, let us carry forward the unfulfilled wishes of the previous generals by courageously moving forward!
As I read history, the heaviness and anger in my heart simmered as I was concerned about the nation. Even though I was born into a cloth gown and included among the common people, I was willing to serve our country voluntarily so that our motherland would prosper and be splendid once again, and I would not regret even if I died. Showing heaven my sincere patriotic heart was adequate.
Here, I composed a poem in the classical form of Ci, to voice the aspirations of my heart.
Paint a deep red lip.
Protect the Diaoyu Islands!
We have bitterly lost our Ryukyu Islands.
How can we allow the Diaoyu Islands to fall to other countries?
100 years of vicissitudes.
Smoke and clouds chased the flying waves.
The youngest brother was still tender youth.
Wandered in all directions and was a seal bear.
Look out for the flags.
We brandished our weapons and crossed to the east.
Let the horses drink the Pacific Ocean.

Why didn't we fight a little Japan?
What do the Chinese still tolerate?
They even rode on our heads.
Do the Chinese guts still do this?
We should tell the whole world that others cannot bully China at will.
It is time for us to show our strength. China has been too calm for too long.
All our citizens' lives are currently too carefree. The officials are too extravagant.
We already have no cohesion now. China needs to start a war. A harsh slap on the face of countries that follow the United States' rear.
Let them know that the US is not a panacea. If we win, China's influence will increase. And citizen cohesion will improve. If we lose, we can clean out the incompetent bureaucrats and make the trash get out. Let China have new blood and get updated. Let China get up.
Go China!
I suggest that China strengthens its guards of the Diaoyu Islands, guards the Diaoyu Islands daily, protects the fishermen and our sovereignty. If Japan dares to invade our territory by military force, we will fight a small-scale war in defense of ourselves, regardless of the cost. China cannot lose.
We need shows in life, but showing who you are to someone is really p.
I just passed by.
This is the whole society, not just the stars.
Damn not sexy.
It's totally unacceptable.
Just a cheap entertainer, their repute in feudal China makes some sense.
Their lives look glorious.
A group of nine professions.
Life is hard.
Shocking.
That's normal. And whores are always heartless and performers are never righteous.
They want the money, not the face.
Look at the wolf with the glasses near Ms. Fan, you know the actor has to drink if he is not forced out or even framed.
a href="http://www.sonofabitch.com/">Sonofabitch/a>
As long as there's something delicious to eat, that's okay.
No one is easy, live is like a show, you have to look at the script to know what you are performing.
All of them are somebody.
In all 360 walks of life, there are people who score top on the Imperial Examination. There is so much effort and endeavor behind those who score top on the Imperial Examination. This humiliates the word "bean vermicelli."
haha
Overdo it.
Reality.
Shoot those hooligans.
a cheap performer.
a cheap performer.
The entertainment circle is dirty, all the men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
It's not easy to be that star female, it's pity for them, but who's to blame?
Everybody does this, how can you make money if you don't?
Women are proud when they are in front of others, but when they stay alone they are in a melancholy mood.
Simply put, nowadays stars are just popular prostitutes from ancient times. Now that they are famous prostitutes, drinking or even sleeping with some high officials should just be normal.
Stop talking to other people, just behave.
What should we do in the future? The ability alone is not enough for success. Will we face such a hard choice too?
More suffering in the name of looking glorious is undisputable.
It's not so bad because they're just playing in their circle, out of sight, out of mind.
But there is an old guy named Zhang Jizhong, who behaves like a hooligan in his circle and also thinks he is virtuous without talent. When he had nothing to do, he made a television series to wreck the people of the whole country.
Both are taking what they need.
When can China have a pure innocent girl?
The story is now very shocking in the entertainment world. Rumor has it that Hsu Yuki was forced out for refusing a company-arranged guest drink and had to switch to working as a lawyer assistant instead to make ends meet.
Stars of much envy often encounter social engagements or circumstances they are not welcome to but have to join in.
After all, they can't decide on many things because it has to do with many aspects and interests of many people.
Sometimes a very normal dinner party for stars, as we ordinary people seem to imagine, may not be that simple for stars as we imagine.
Stars have a lot of contracts and if they tackle it well, they'll roll in the money source. If she doesn't tackle it well, the force of the out or even the frame will come tearing her heels.
Those first kind people always hold very high integrity, and sternly reject all such invitations. Star-smart females are two kinds.
The second kind is good at playing tricks and achieving their objectives with their seed money.
Even some super star females are rumored to have won their first roles this way.
After drinking some alcohol, the advertiser or show sponsor may get a chance to lie on the star's shoulder, feel her chin, or kiss her cheek, and the star will most likely adopt an endured attitude.
They are very people in the 9 lower professions.
Those stars are just pretending and actually living a much better damn life than this.
Just a cheap entertainer, their repute in feudal China makes some sense.
Agreed.
Oh well, acting isn't easy.
They deserve it, they asked for that.
It dawned on me that nothing is easy.
Women are birds and beasts, men are worse than birds and beasts.
Braawwk.
Braawwkkk.
It doesn't take long.
Late in 040000, Route 288 opened its circumference around the southwest quadrant of the Richmond New Urban Region.
It already changed the development patterns for the worse and caused localized congestion of traffic around its exits.
The Richmond Times-Dispatch told a tale today about the impact of the Huguenot Trail in Powhatan County.
Will Jones reports that traffic on one section of the Huguenot Trail has more than doubled since the opening of 288.
There will be a surge in speed and accidents as well.
So far this year, 17 accidents have been reported near the Winterfield Road intersection, up from all of 2004's 12.
Virginia Department of Transportation resident engineer Dale Totten noted that if the Virginia Department of Transportation had more money it would have built 4 lanes of roads at a cost of about 13 million dollars.
Of course VDOT doesn't have the money to construct roads in the Richmond region.
Because VDOT spent all their frigging money on 288 with local politicians and boosters.
Where is Homer Simpson when you need him?
Doh, this is a major moment.
Route 288 will, as we predicted, generate residential development in the scarcely populated areas all around its exits, overtaxing local county roads.
Others choose where they work and live, but a limited access highway could relieve traffic for drivers who drive back and forth between Chesterfield and Goochland Counties.
And they created congestion of traffic in the new places.
Only this rapid surprised me.
I even think the lag could be 3 or 4 years.
Think about the liability that Route 288 would create at all its exits, it already created a $13 million road construction cost at just this one exit.
Another prediction.
After a few more years of scattered subdivision development and the approval of mega-commercial projects at the intersection of 288 and major roads, the need for new road improvements will soar.
We can well see that before the decade ends, the unfunded liabilities will zoom well past the original $400 million it took to build the original highway.
"Route 288 is such a great idea," said the brainiac who thought it was such a great idea.
Thanks for nothing.
I think we could have spent the $400 million better elsewhere.
I don't think you should be blaming 288 for creating those people.
If they are enough to create congestion of traffic in new places, what is the alternative?
Additional traffic congestion in the old places?
Now you understand how people like TMT in Fairfax feel.
I usually take the pro-road position.
But 288 is definitely an excess compared to the glaring need in other parts of the state.
Richmond has virtually no traffic.
Rush hour lasts 30 minutes.
And you give them a beltway in a large rural area.
The road to nowhere.
Just think, this money could be spent on another Potomac crossing or a desperately needed road improvement in NOVA.
Adding insult to injury, the Virginia Centrist said the rest of the state helped pay for 288 in the budget deal last year, wiping out the debt.
Very nice of you all to oblige us.
However, it doesn't make much sense.
The same old problem as it is.
If you get ahead of need, you will be accused of causing the sprawl.
Claim you can't pave your way out of congestion if you build in a place where the need is already acute.
Anonymous
That's a fair point.
5:26 makes a good point.
But this situation has hammered home the validity of the state auditor's report that found CTB and VDOT funded transportation projects based on who was the best lobbyist rather than a comprehensive plan for state transportation.
I submit that this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated.
And Senator Chichester and his toadies have poured more money into this flawed institution, making this worse.
What are the transport expenses for?
In Virginia, it was for the benefit of a private business plan, not to serve the public interest.
You all are dead wrong.
Walter Stoch stated no less that the money for economic development was intended to be paid for by 288.
C'mon folks.
I don't understand your point, TMT.
When was the last time you stuck in traffic if you weren't in some sort of business or from one?
Seems to me that the whole point of the road is to facilitate the public interest in getting into and out of private business.
There is an overwhelming need for business support, despite the Sunday drive, the trip to the grandmother's location, and the soccer game of course.
No wonder we suffer from congestion problems, our road expenditure does not match the increase in business or state GDP.
If we recognize that the road is primarily for the benefit of the business, we should do two things.
Businesses should pay more into our transportation bills, of course, and we should incentivize them to locate where the system is least stressed, even if that means more overall travel.
Why is it so hard to understand?
The solution lies in functioning human settlement patterns and in balancing the capacity of transport systems with the travel demand generated by land use.
Spin all else.

In Virginia, TMT said, "It was for the benefit of a private business plan, not to serve the public interest."
I don't see the point of this statement, it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else.
I think they are tightly intertwined so that they are virtually the same.
The local problem is obvious, this cookie dough is lumpy.
But if we demonize business long enough, we will eventually all find ourselves working for the devil in aggregate.
I don't see the point in claiming that the solution is a balance of dynamic and ever changing nature.
Even you see the positives with the Dulles rail, it's a job center that promotes bidirectional rail demand.
I agree.
In fact, that could suffice all on it's own given the reason it was built.
All I'm saying is that the exact same logic should be applied to the road.
They should have a destination at both ends so that we can use our investments to the maximum.
We need more places to get closer to the balance you say we need.
Here's a reality check.
I drive past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
I commute back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail.
I have never seen anything remotely like a traffic flood.
It's a 55 mph zone with between 75 and 100 cars per morning.
Due to the heavy demand for development on the Chesterfield side, new schools, and the whole bunch of existing developments that were zoned years ago and funneled through Robious Road, the Huguenot Trail is already planned to be widen.
Instead of bottlenecking Powhatan and western Chesterfield, 288 would be wonderful for those of us who actually use it.
We could develop commercially and work closer to where we live.
You might think that was an irrational use of land.
I have no desire to live in any city.
I refused to work in the downtown area.
I refuse to use mass transit that is unsafe for commuting females who work long irregular hours.
And I happen to like the development of large lots.
I don't understand exactly how I'm supposed to keep horses on a 1/4 acre lot.
1 gallon of gas can go for $10.
And I still pay to live in the country.
Many people legitimately prefer horses, hunting, gardening, and certain types of small businesses, which makes them not want to live in urban cores.
This infatuation with city life truly baffles me.
Anonymous 6:37, you have every right to live in the country if you wish to.
But you have no right to underwrite the rest of the state's $400 million highway construction to make shopping and getting to work easier.
There has been a consistent overlooking of what else could be spent the $400 million in the debate over 288.
If the money were applied to other pressing road projects or god forbid even non-road projects, it could alleviate much of the traffic congestion.
Ray Hyde, my comments are directed at the investors who lobby to place roads near where they own property and to the incompetent system that funds these requests regardless of whether or not they are linked to a master transport plan.
I'm 24 and a 2.5 year old mother.
I've been breaking up with my son's father since August.
I want to start dating other people and my sons father says he has nothing to do with him.
He's very possessive and controlling, but he's not right because we're together.
There's too much going on in his life right now and despite me telling him several times I don't love him and he doesn't love me, he thinks we could work.
I want him there for his son, but he doesn't need me too.
But he has no one. His family doesn't get along with him and they have issues.
I don't want to be miserable anymore and I'll be more miserable the longer he's around.
I don't want him not being there for his son, he's a good father or at least trying to be.
I believe that every child needs both parents whether they are together or not.
But if he can't have me, he thinks no one can.
What am I going to do with my life?
It's very bad when your ex threatens you and uses your son.
You have to not give into that, because if you do, it just escalates it.
You have a right to live your life and be happy, don't cave in under his threats.
He sees him regardless, he really loves his son, but this is just a typical control method that people like him use.
Others have said it's like it's killing me if you leave me, does it get through to you?
Date yourself.
Meet all kinds of people.
Do what you want.
You'd probably be better off not having him, for the price of him voluntarily walking out of your lives, both of you.
I agree, one other thing, it's not his business whether you date or not.
I didn't tell him.
Not because he's a threat, but because he has no concern for your personal life.
Can you document his threats?
You really need.
Quit taking his calls and make him leave a voice mail.
Make him email or text you.
Keep that record.
Get a lawyer and get a divorce.
If you can't afford one, try legal aid.
Tell your ex that all communication needs to go through a lawyer.
Bus drivers, tillers and food delivery people want exactly the same change.
Don't they realise you don't get a pile of change in the bank?
Someone has to take a note somewhere?
People get lazy.
I like to be as near as possible because I don't like to count the coppers all day.
They'll just tell you to get on the bus because they're lazy as hell, take a £20 note on the bus.
It is illegal to pay a certain amount with a load of coins, you can only pay something like 30p with a pence.
Hello, I started uni in September, but obviously, like most people, I didn't gel immediately.
I'm always very introverted, shy, anxious and all the rest, but I know it will take some time to adjust.
All my housemates and I went out the first night I was here and it was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.
When I was sober I went to the student union bar on my own.
Here's the fact, but more to the point.
After about 5 months here I haven't enjoyed the university. I'm disillusioned with the courses, I don't enjoy set projects and I don't like the delivery of the courses much.
Universities make it out to be much better than it seems.
I'm starting my first term badly, financial delays for students adding to my stress levels, and I'm so worried I can't make any progress with my work, so all piles up.
I was assigned a counsellor at uni and saw her for about 5-6 weeks in block sessions, it really didn't work out in my opinion because I never opened up to her.
Only half the heart.
Now I have a load of work up my neck, I have to hit a major deadline, I'm depressed and the anxiety has resulted in me feeling miserable all the time.
I no longer have a counsellor, you can only have so many sessions at a time, and I doubt he would help me much this time if he had already helped me.
I lack motivation, I don't feel comfortable with lecturers, I feel I want to give in but can't bring it about because I end up in a job that ends in death and aspire to be someone.
I'd rather die than be uneducated and not live the life I want to live, and by dropping out of uni I've made matters worse.
I'm 21 and turning 22 this year, I don't have much time left to fail, so I have to do something.
I failed college once and did another course so I could get into uni, I don't want to go through the system over and over and fail consistently.
Please can someone give me some advice?
Go and see your doctor if you can and see if there's a way you can get your deadline extended to try and ease the pressure a bit.
Send a similar email to this post to your tutor and they will consider mitigation circumstances. Don't worry, they've seen it all before, including some admissions that are much more uncomfortable. I know because I used to work in a university administration department.
Break up your work into manageable chunks.
Concentrate on one bit of work at a time, the most urgent first assignment obviously.
Don't shut off your housemates and do well as you are trying new things from the very beginning. Keep it up now.
I would recommend going to see your doctor too.
If you're always anxious speaking to someone can be beneficial - my anxiety friend gets therapy from the NHS so it's really normal.
If you're being honest, I'm sure your university will allow it, and try to get the deadline extended.
Keep strong and carry on living, that gets hard.
My mum divorced. She had a horrible time with my step-father and the new freedom she found sent her round the bend.
She has epilepsy, is manic depressed and has a huge anger problem.
She is constantly horrible to me.
When I was at home I couldn't cope with her outbursts and hateful and nasty remarks.
I was 18, with a 95% bursary, studying full time in a high pressure private sixth form at the point I broke.
I can't work at home because she shouts at me.
So then I got angry with my teacher.
She was lovely for one minute one minute like I had my mummy back then the next minute she turned into the most spiteful human alive.
I haven't passed my A2 and I've already accepted defeat and that this year of my life has made me a failure.
How can I possibly come back from this? The most amazing thing is that the university offered me a place, but I couldn't even accept it. I never made a grade.
I wish I could wipe her out of my life, things would be so much better without her.
But then I thought I was just being selfish.
But surely this doesn't mean my life is like this does it?
It should have been so much better.
But I feel like I have no control over this downward spiral.
And I don't know what to do.
Thanks for reading.
Nice vent.
You can't get her section for that.
Does she even have a history of mental illness or a diagnosis?
You sure don't know if you won't get a good grade, so accept the place if you can.
Life throws things at you all the time.
Outsiders aren't someone in your family.
I had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for 8 years before I came to uni, and honestly the only reason I'm here is because it's the only way out.
If you really want out, you have to work hard.
It really sounds like you need support somewhere else if she can't consistently give it to you.
Could you call Childline or something like that?
You can go to the library on a Saturday and study there for a good 8 hours.
Can you go to a friend's house to form a study group?
You want her sectioned because it's a bit of a pain in the arse and you're blaming it for all your problems?
I know how you feel.
My mum was spit in hell too.
I highly recommend taking up smoking.
Oh grow up tsr and stop nagging, it's a joke.
I think in the past year or two I've become much weaker and my personality has dulled down in a way in between to try and make friends at uni.
But being nice over leads people to believe they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me.
They show absolutely no respect.
For example, I say hello to someone from university and they ignore me, but 30 minutes later they decide they want me to help them with some work and I give it to them.
It's caused a lot of anger and distress in my life and has really started to affect my concentration at uni.
Has anyone got any experience with how to handle these sorts of things or how to go about gaining some respect again?
You just said no.
If you're particularly uncomfortable with it, do it gradually.
Maybe you can start with "I'm sorry but I'm busy".
Of course, you don't go over the top with it, so you don't go in the completely opposite direction.
If you think no, keep that in mind, then say no.
When they start realizing they aren't going to bend over backwards for you, they start respecting you more.
Well, this really is such a bad attitude. Of course, you can be respected if you're nice, but not nice enough to just let them do anything to you. That's not nice, that's a fool.
I don't know if anyone has read this but I just feel despair and feel the need to tell someone.
I'm leaving home in September and starting university, I'm incredibly anxious to do this, but have delayed thinking about it until I've got here, I'm here now and over the next two weeks, I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel incredibly incompetent and socially awkward.
Since moving to secondary school I have had an emotional struggle for the majority of my life, although I lost my dad around the age of 9 and have always blamed it on how I felt. I have had two counselling periods in my life between December 2009 and around March of this year, roughly 15 months.
At the moment I feel like my life problems are overwhelming in an uncredible way and I am making ever more doubts about my always low self esteem. I am unable to concentrate on work, I often find myself becoming very quiet on social occasions and I doubt myself about anything and everything.
My two counsellors haven't diagnosed me with depression and have suggested I don't suffer from it, but I'm hugely worried about it, as depression caused my dad's death and his suicide.
I have tried to solve my own problems before, and have found exercise and meditation particularly useful, and have also tried things like self help books and tapes. However, this is generally what I feel like living with. I have wasted one chance at existence and one chance at being a young man. These feelings have been beaten away from me.
I simply don't know what to do and never follow through when I think of what to do. My friends often say I'm lazy and I can't disagree a lot of the time. I feel like people are trying everything they can to help and I fail time and time again.
I'm sorry for anyone who reads this jumbled mess, I feel a bit like a self-seeking moaner, but I truly feel despair.
It is common for existing feelings of self-worth to become more intense when a person is in a new situation and feels the pressure to socialise with strangers and fit into a new role, such as a student at university.
I'm not a health professional and can only speak from personal experience, so I strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional regarding how you feel and worry about depression.
Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to university, so you definitely aren't alone there. However, I really recommend you get an appointment with the counselling service at your university, it doesn't really matter if anyone tells you you're depressed or not, you obviously have some problems at the minute and could use some support, labels are not as important as your experience, meditation and exercise are really helpful, so try doing them, but don't beat yourself up for not feeling motivated to do anything at the minute.
Good luck.
I think a lot more people feel the same way as you, but medicate themselves by using friends, probably not a solution as such, but definitely better to be around friends when you're depressed than being alone and depressed. Feel free to PM me either way if you fancy a chat.
If I were you, I would focus on idols, you would aspire to someone, someone who comes from a bad background, ends up successful, happy, has a family, married, etc. You wouldn't want to be them, but someone you admire and respect.
You are focusing on what you have achieved in life. You have not stated what you studied or indeed why you studied. Because you want experience? Because your mum wants you gone? Because you need a degree for the career you want?
Either way, you'll sum up why you're there and work your bottom off to get the best grades possible, because once you get your degree you'll have something to say (hey, I didn't fail, I worked hard and passed)

I hope this helps.
I'm pretty much not autistic (I'm not diagnosed with dyspraxia, I think the doctor misdiagnosed me), but I walk on my toes nearly all the time.
I'm more comfortable with it.
Since toe walking seems so random and doesn't always indicate autism, what makes them decide it's a sign?
Well, I may have a sign of something on the autism spectrum, but who doesn't have one or two?
You guys know what I mean.
Walking on one toe may be an autism symptom.
Headaches can be a symptom of a brain tumor.
Feeling tired a lot could be a leukaemia symptom.
Symptoms don't always apply, but in a lot of cases, as this instance clearly shows, there are symptoms worth noting, so nothing is ever diagnosed without note.
I walk on my toes, but that's because I was born with a strange under curled toe that had to be surgically straightened two years ago.
My brother is autistic but I don't notice it either, but the spectrum is so broad and I probably have mild Asperger's, which causes communication problems and I don't pick up on social reactions/body language.
But then I don't have the proper diagnosis and you might even have some symptoms, which doesn't mean you have a certain condition.
I haven't walked on my toes much because I've been told for years that I don't walk on my toes.
I have dyspraxia.
So you may be dyspraxic or have a short tendon.
Dance/gymnastics/ballet people are drilling into it so I find it more comfortable now.
I haven't read too much into random symptoms like that.
Hello, I'm a 12 year old girl who is self harming and will be 13 in 2 days.
I started slitting each individual finger with a scissors at the age of 7 and never stopped from that day on.
It's worse because I have a scar on my leg from slitting it with a staple on my ex-boyfriend's name because I didn't stop the cuts bleeding.
I have several slits in my arms.
They healed and I cut myself with the stapler I used to rob the school and a razor.
When the cut isn't found, I take around 5 paracetamols and other drugs and take them with lager and vodka.
As I write this I am really tempted to cut or burn my arms.
I'm an addict. When one heals, I cut again.
I think about it every day.
I'm 12 and my life is already sick.
My dad left when I was 7 and doesn't want to know me anymore is the source of this.
He just cares about his new little girl, his wife and his new life, which I don't want.
My best mate died when I was 10.
I was in a relationship with a 16 year old boy and was forbid from speaking to him because of what happened and the age difference.
My mum also suffers from bipolar and I have depression.
I don't want to stop.
I don't care what's done to me, I want it done again and again to torture me, I hate myself.
But i love my best mate loads, he means the world to me and would do anything if i did anything.
I didn't tell him, he found out.
I don't want to hurt him. I don't want him to hurt me.
What do I do?
Thanks for reading.
Are you on any drug or getting any therapy from it?
You should talk to your school nurse or your GP and tell them what's going on.
There might be a school teacher you can trust to tell you.
People can help you if you tell them.
If you keep it bottled up on the inside, it will likely only get worse.
Trust me, it's better to get these things sorted asap rather than letting them get worse.
Please don't do this.
I'm 17 and started self harm last year (mainly arm cuts) but stopped a few months ago.
It's hard, but you can do it.
I feel so much happier, but seeing the scars reminds me of how I felt at that time and how strong it was that I wanted to do such a thing to myself.
And strong also. You can do it. It is a salvation to write poetry and keep a journal.
Self-harm is addictive, but you can overcome it.
Remember self harm does not define who you are.
You can overcome it.
I find myself always checking what belongs to me every time I go out especially to uni in the past year to make sure nothing is lost or left behind, so I think I've got a form of OCD.
I often have to check twice in one go and then for some reason after 30 seconds I can't resist checking again.
Why is this?
Am I crazy or is there something?
It's most often when it carries many but rarely when it carries few, and it still checks many even every day. Is this an OCD to any extent?
What can I do about this?
I get very anxious unchecked, that sort of goes away after 15-30 minutes, but often it's so much anxiety that I can't wait that long.
I feel doomed if I lose my wallet or phone, or I feel doomed.
I just wish I could go out every two minutes without worrying about leaving or losing something.
I really don't know what to do and am afraid to go to a GP.
They probably have never heard of some compulsion like this and I just don't know what to do.
Do any of you have similar rituals?
People think I'm crazy, but it's very strange how difficult it is to get out of this.
What can you advise me on?
I used to do this on my way to college. I had a list of things I knew I had on me and I used to compulsively check on the bus.
I know it's easier said than done, but I'm now having more severe anxiety and think this is a warning sign, so just try weaning the habit when it's relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor, but also tell yourself not to keep checking these things.
The doctor saw a much worse case so don't worry about that.
I did an emoticon on OCD in a psychology class today.
The only way you can get rid of it is to just avoid the compulsive act, so don't check if you've lost something and just leave it at that.
While your anxiety level will increase for a duration, it will decrease gradually, so that hopefully your OCD will disappear overtime.
That just sounds like you're overly anxious rather than having really bad OCD to me.
I'm very obsessed with getting up every 20 minutes every night to check that all the locks in my house are in particular locked.
Sometimes I get convinced they aren't locked, even though I know they are.
I think when the obsession starts really interrupting your daily routine, it becomes a real problem.
You're definitely not crazy, don't worry, I'm sure your GP will understand the issue.
I went to therapy also for other reasons and they encouraged me to pick a number that was obviously less than 20 and check it, stick with it and cut down.
I think it's an idea to teach myself, and if I check 5 times or 20 times, I'm still OK.
So far I'm a lot better and I think there's definitely hope for anyone who wants to improve.
I'm usually pretty calm about things, like to take things as they come, and don't worry too much.
But in the past month or so I have found myself becoming really anxious about things and haven't talked about the mere feeling of nervousness out of the blue.
I began to feel irrationally panicked over a variety of things that I didn't worry about too much beforehand, that didn't even cross my mind as something that would ring an alarm bell in my head.
I'm not sure if this is because of a lifestyle change (students going from care free to graduates unemployed) or if it's a sign of other issues, but it's beginning to bug me because it affects my confidence and happiness.
I've spoken to a few people, including my parents, but all the same they all think I'm going through random phases and should hold off acting until the serious problem is clear.
So wonder what the best thing to do is?
Speak to a doctor about it and see if the anti anxiety pill can take the edge off of things?
See if I can speak to a counsellor?
Or should I just take the advice of those close to me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem?
Well, I shouldn't start trying to eye your anxiety, because it makes me tense and you more likely to panic. There's a demise circle.
As soon as you start feeling a bit panicked about anything, I recommend trying to focus on something that guarantees to make you smile or feel happier.
Or if you can't do that, get a friend to make you laugh when you start feeling panicky (it works for me and I suffer random panic attacks lol).
I'm starting to really worry about the tiny things, even though they're not as severe as you sound like they are.
I find that just talking to someone else about what makes you anxious helps.
I find that when I mention my worries to my mum and see how she reacts to the situation in the calm way she should, it makes me feel better and I know it's not a big deal and I don't need to be anxious about it, but perhaps in a non-moaning way.
But if it gets worse, go to the doctor.
I have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety and may prevent her from leaving the house and doing things because she is so worried about what could go wrong.
The doctor gave her the medication and it made her much better.

The International Atomic Energy Agency reached an agreement with Iranian officials stating that there are no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding Iran's nuclear program and activities.
U.S. and European officials suspect that Iran's civilian nuclear energy program masks efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce an atomic bomb.
U.S. and European officials suspect that Iran's civilian nuclear energy program masks efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce an atomic bomb.
Officials from the U.S. and Europe could impose a fourth round of sanctions on Tehran when the U.N. Security Council most likely considers the issue of Iran's nuclear energy program in September 2007.
The International Atomic Energy Agency distributed a limited number of copies of the IAEA report before its 35-member board meeting on 11 September 2007.
The findings reflect an agreement between the Agency and Tehran on 070821 which was made public by Iranian officials beginning the week of 070812.
The accord said there remains no issue and no ambiguity regarding Iran's nuclear program and activities.
According to a Reuters news account the IAEA report said the work plan was a significant step forward.
A senior U.N. official was quoted by Reuters as stating that Iranian government efforts to enrich uranium are slowing down.
The IAEA report stated that Iranian officials must continue to build confidence in the scope and nature of Iran's present and future nuclear programs.
Iranian officials stated on 30 August 2007 that Iranian officials will cooperate with the IAEA so that a further round of international sanctions can be prevented.
Iran's representative to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to the Fars news agency in Tehran that the report emphasizes that there are no signs or evidence indicating Iran's nuclear activities have been diverted and that all Iran's nuclear material has been audited.
Some non-proliferation experts stated that the IAEA had ceded too much to Iran.
In a critique published the week of 19 August 2007 Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security (ISISS) arms control expert David Albright and IAEA arms control expert Jacqueline Shire wrote that the idea of closing files violated fundamental safeguard principles and that the agreement did not specify that Iranian officials provide the IAEA with access to key people, facilities and documents needed to verify the Agency's answers to questions.
Independent experts stated that Iran's latest agreement with the IAEA to allow inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information is short of Western demands that Iran halt production of concentrated uranium that could be used in a bomb.
U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that Iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program but that the report may offer some new details or insights into Iran's program development.
Casey stated that the nuclear program continues to move forward showing that the Iranian regime continues to defy the international community.
Most Western non-proliferation experts stated that the 070821 agreement contained little that could dissuade policymakers in Washington, London, Paris and Berlin from moving forward with another round of Security Council sanctions.
Experts stated that many of the transparency issues reported resolved in the agreement on August 21, 2007 should have previously been resolved.
Executive Director of the nonpartisan Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl G. Kimball stated that the agreement addresses the problem of the Iranian government's pursuit of enriched technology and capabilities which could lead to the production of nuclear bomb materials.
Kimball stated that the Iranian government is designed to deflect criticism and pressure and claim that progress has been made.
Iranian officials stated that with more sanctions Iran could reduce through collaboration with inspectors.
The Security Council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on Iran despite U.S. demands that the penalties be limited by pressure from China and Russia.
In an interview with state-controlled Iranian television, Soltanieh stated that the reports and measures make no relevant and unjustified intervention by any other international organization including the Security Council.

The Nuclear Suppliers Group will be distributed a document outlining Israel's proposal to allow the transfer of nuclear technology to international states that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for India from engaging in nuclear trade.
Israeli officials convinced a key group of nuclear trade-engaged nations to adopt a new international guideline allowing the transfer of nuclear technology to non-proliferation-rule signatories.
Countries including India, Israel and Pakistan that have not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade including the purchase of reactors, uranium fuel or yellowcake.
A document outlining Israel's proposal was distributed to 45 members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group in March 2007.
The Israeli presentation was made on no paper allowing for official denial.
A letter from the NSG chairman said the Israeli presentation was offered on 070317 in the context of the NSG's debate over an Indian official's bid for exemption.
India and Israel are the only two nations that have not signed the treaty to qualify for admission to the NSG under India's proposal.
The Israeli plan offers 12 criteria for allowing trade with non-Treaty nuclear States.
One criterion indicates Israel's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and says that if the State applies stringent physical protection, control and accounting measures to all nuclear weapons on its territory, to all nuclear facilities on its territory, to all nuclear source materials on its territory and to all special nuclear materials on its territory then the State should be allowed to engage in the nuclear trade.
The document was circulated on Capitol Hill in September 2007 as the Bush administration worked toward an agreement with Indian officials.
Executive Director of the Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl Kimball stated that the Israeli documents could affect the debate over India.
Kimball stated --
The dynamic at the NSG is that country officials do not want obstacles to India being the largest country and the United States being the most powerful.
A consensus on India will be difficult to reach at the NSG meeting in November 2007.
The Israeli proposal gives officials in some countries reason to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
Israel's record of following international nuclear rules is good and better than India's.
Despite the tie between the Israeli and U.S. governments, the Bush administration rejected Israel's proposal.
The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for India from engaging in nuclear trade.
President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice view the pact as an important part of the Bush administration's foreign policy legacy.
The deal is controversial in India and Congress must give approval.
With the election year delayed the most negatively, the delay in winning approval for the Indian deal could have a negative effect on the foreign policy legacy of the administration.
State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that the U.S. government views the Indian deal as unique and does not see it as a precedent for any other country including Israel.
Israeli embassy spokesman David Siegel stated that suggestions that the Israeli government would demand exemptions or link the effort to any other issue including the debate over India are grossly inaccurate.
Seigel stated --
The Israeli government has never asked or specifically requested the NSG to exempt Israel from nuclear supply guidelines.
Israel is recognized as adhering fully to the NSG Guidelines.
The Israeli Government urged the NSG to consider adopting a generic multi-tiered criteria-based approach to nuclear technology transfer.
Some NSG officials have previously suggested an approach similar to the Israeli plan.
The nuclear non-proliferation regime would be considerably enhanced if the NSG Guidelines were modified along the lines proposed by Israeli officials.

Ahmadinejad announced the expansion of Iran's uranium production capabilities.
Iran refuses to commit to halting expansion but hint at possible future halts.
Iranian President Mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of Mashbad on 26 July 2008 that Iran has expanded its arsenal of enriched uranium centrifuges to over 5000.
Ahmadinejad's assertion of the expansion is the first since the April 2008 announcement of an approach to Iran to implement 6000 centrifuges.
Iran articulated the goal of 50000 centrifuges operating at the enrichment plant near Natanz.
The international community has demanded that Iran halt its nuclear material production.
The media reports are different from the number of centrifuges cited by Ahmadinejad.
Iranian news agencies reported that Ahmadinejad stated Iran has 6000 working centrifuges but subsequently removed the statement from the Internet.
Another Iranian news agency stated that Ahmadinejad had referred to hundreds of thousands of centrifuges.
Experts discounted the significance of Ahmadinejad's claim in the absence of information on the functionality of the centrifuge.
A Western diplomat in Tehran speaking on condition of anonymity stated that the number of centrifuges was less important than the machine's operation and efficiency but Ahmadinejad's assertions hindered resolution of the diplomatic standoff between Iran and the West.
Arms control expert at the New America Foundation Jeffrey G. Lewis stated that the think tank is aware of Iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but the status of the machines is unknown.
Diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems hinder Iran's enrichment program.
Iran has repeatedly asserted that Iran's nuclear program is aimed only at producing electricity because nuclear weapons production contradicts Islamic principles.
The majority of western arms control experts including the US, Israel and Europe believe Iran is pursuing the capability to produce a bomb immediately upon decision.
Experts stated that producing weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade materials is relatively simple.
Ahmadinejad stated that the Western world is still pursuing a resume of negotiations after Iran resisted Western demands to halt Iran's nuclear activities.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana recently presented 2 offers to Iran.
A package of incentives to cease production of enriched uranium endorsed by the US.
During the prenegotiations there was a freeze-for-freeze period of six weeks during which Iran did not add the centrifuge and the West refrained from promoting the 4th round of economic sanctions against Iran to the UN Security Council.
US officials have repeatedly stated that negotiations cannot begin before Iran verifiably halts all enrichment-related activities but the Bush administration recently agreed to the proposed freeze and dispatched Burns to Geneva.
On 26 July 2008 at talks in Geneva attended by US Undersecretary of State William J. Burns Iran refused to respond to Solana's offer.
The talks constitute the highest level of diplomatic contacts between the US and Iran in nearly 30 years.
Solana, Burns and European envoys set a deadline for Iran to respond positively before initiating new sanctions including a prohibition on the sale of refined petroleum products vital to Iran's economy.
Iranian officials refused to commit to stopping the expansion or observing a deadline.
On 26 July 2008 Ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that Iran could potentially halt expansion over 6 weeks with a number of centrifuges higher than previously expected.
Ahmadinejad stated that if the number of existing and operational centrifuges did not increase, the West would consent to between 5000 and 6000 of them.
If highly enriched, 5000 centrifuges could produce enough nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb.
A continuous run of 6000 centrifuges could produce weapons-grade uranium sufficient for 1 bomb in 6 months.
In May 2008 the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that Iran possesses 3500 operational centrifuges.

Diplomatic meetings in Paris concluded without agreement on further steps to pressure Iran to halt uranium enrichment at Iran's Natanz facility.
Diplomats stated to the media on 14 November 2008 at a meeting in Paris on 13 November 2008 that officials from the United States, Europe, Russia and China had not reached an agreement to further act to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment at the Chinese facility in Natanz.
Uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for nuclear power plants and produce fissile material for atomic weapons.
The meeting on November 13, 2008 ended without any new measures announced.
After the meeting on 13 November 2008 the French Foreign Ministry released a statement declaring that the international community reaffirms the importance of a dual track approach to diplomatic engagement with Iran and towards sanctions work.
Russia and China are resisting new sanctions against Iran.
Russia and China have close political and business ties with Iran and do not feel domestic pressure to act against Iran.
The United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran have no close political and business ties and feel domestic pressure to act against Iran.
Russia and China hold the power to veto Security Council decisions.
Russian diplomat Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by the Moscow news agency Interfax as saying that at the meeting on November 13, 2008 no party had struck a deal on sanctions against Iran and that Western countries were in favor of the sanctions while China and Iran did not support them.
Sergei Ryabkov will attend the meeting on November 13, 2008.
There were significant progress reports on Iran's heavy-water research reactor near Arak released this week.
Iran's heavy-water research reactor near Arak could eventually produce plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons.
A satellite image published by the Institute for Science and International Security shows significant progress in the construction of a heavy-water research reactor near Arak from February 2008 through October 2008.
David Albright stated that the Iranian heavy-water research reactor near Arak evaded notice from the international security community.
David Albright stated that satellite images say that the Iranian heavy-water research reactor near Arak is making significant progress and has progressed from a building frame to a large finished facility in the past year and a half.
David Albright is a former arms inspector and the director of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.
Iran stated that Iran is pursuing nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research.
The United States and its western allies suspect that Iran's production efforts are preceded by the creation of a nuclear weapons infrastructure.
The production of low-grade uranium is legal under international arms control regulations.
Iran's latest nuclear technology development shows the complex technical and diplomatic challenge facing the incoming foreign policy team of President-elect Barack Obama to take on the task of stopping Iran from mastering the technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons.
Last month while the Bush administration was in power the United States President George W. Bush managed to synchronize US policy with European Union leaders, the leaders of Britain, France and Germany to press for tougher sanctions and diplomatic action against Iran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is expected to release a report critical of Iran next week.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is a United Nations nuclear watchdog.
There are decreasing hopes that another set of United Nations Security Council sanctions will be imposed before the end of President Bush's term because no new initiative on Iran's nuclear program emerged for the talks in Paris on November 13, 2008.
During diplomatic maneuvers Iran continued to work toward mastering nuclear and missile technologies.
Some Israeli officials stated that they were alarmed by Iran's test firing of two solid-fuel stage rockets with a range of 1200 miles this week.
Tel Aviv is less than 650 miles from Iranian territory.

A high-security Russian laboratory complex that stores anthrax, plague and other deadly bacilli faces electricity loss due to lack of payment to Mosenergo electricity utility.
A large repository of deadly anthrax, plague and other bacterium stored in a Russian high-security laboratory complex 100 miles south of Moscow threatens to lose electricity.
Officials from Moscow region electricity utility Mosenergo recently arrived at the Russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off electricity due to lack of payment.
The Russian laboratory complex is a campus of 90 buildings and served as a location for a secret biological weapons program during the Soviet era.
A incorrect headline in Izvestia newspaper stated that the deadly virus was a threat to Moscow's regional depositories.
The virus was not located at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
The State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is a killing place for every kind of bacterium studied for use in the secret Soviet biological weapons program.
A large virus repository is located in Siberia.
Russian and Western officials stated that the power cut at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology was unlikely to result in any threat to public health.
Russian and western officials stated that there is not enough certainty to know whether the loss of power at the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology is a health threat to the public.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology has quite reliable emergency protection systems.
General Nikolai N. Urakov is the long-time director of the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
Western scientists are working with the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology to convert the complex into a biomedical manufacturing site.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that people at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology were scared by this threat of sudden shut-down of electricity because of a kind of psychological pressure.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that if power was shut down at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology, scientists would have to destroy all bacteriological experiments that were in the way.
General Nikolai N. Urakov likes another 500000 dollars annually from the United States and Western countries to pay the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology's electric bills and arrears. The United States and Western countries have contributed about 6 million American dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapon complex.
American scientists who work closely with the State Scientific Center of applied microbiology stated that the Russian government is responsible for paying the State Scientific Center's electric bill.
Western aid to one of General Nikolai N. Urakov's bioweapons laboratories peaked in 1997 when it was learned that Iran had offered to purchase experts from the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
It is known that the sense of crisis was orchestrated to increase finance by Russian scientists and military leaders who now depend on western finance to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
American scientist Randall Lee Beatty is working to convert the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
Beatty stated that this threat of electricity cuts at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is a crisis.
Randall Lee Beatty is the director of the International Science and Technology Center.
The International Science and Technology Center has financed approximately half of the budget for supporting about 350 Russian biowarfare scientists and technicians -- General Nikolai N. Urakov.
Randall Lee Beatty stated that it was known that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology had not paid its electricity bill for 14 months.
Randall Lee Beatty stated that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is one of the world's most important archives of dangerous pathogens and it is shameful that it has been destroyed due to non-payment to electricity utilities.
Approximately 3000 strains of bacterium are stored at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology and many of them are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment by layer enclosures and oversize air handling systems that depend on electricity for function.
The greatest danger from shutting down electric power at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is the defrosting of live germs currently preserved in a frozen state.
Biology warfare expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies Raymond Zilinskas stated that the main threat to organisms is the power cut to the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology rather than the threat of their escape.
Raymond Zilinskas stated that in the worst case the bacterium defrosted at room temperature and the real mess was the cleanup afterward because it is certainly not known if all the bacterium had died.
Another example is the confrontation between electricity utility Mosenergo and the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk, where the basic capitalist imperative of enterprise sustainability may dangerously clash with the old remains of Soviet weapons science.
In 2000 the overdue power bill caused the Russian National Power Company to cut off electricity to the strategic base where nuclear missiles stand on high alert.
A nuclear missile silo does not lose power.
Armed troops marched into the substation and turned the power back on.
National energy system United energy systems cut power in January 2001 and February 2001 at a number of military installations around Russia.
The military installation that lost power included a monitoring center for the Russian space forces in Kamchatka.
In most cases when the electricity is cut off at a military installation, it is quickly restored.
Investigative reports often show a war tug between utilities and the military that forces the military to spend the electricity power from budget funds rather than diverting the money to other uses.
Some of the budgetary funds that are cut at times include building residences in the country for the generals.

Brazil has implemented a law allowing the Brazilian Air Force to target drug trafficking aircraft within Brazilian airspace.
The US is concerned about liability for misidentification of civilian planes.
Brazil announced that the Brazilian Air Force will begin shooting down aircraft used in trafficking illegal drugs in Brazilian airspace.
The plan required eight precautionary steps before an order to shoot down the plane could be issued.
The publicity campaign notified ranchers and other people that they needed to file a flight plan prior to the policy taking effect in late October 2004.
The law permitting such actions was originally approved in 1998 but President Fernando Henrique Cardoso never put the policy into effect.
Cardoso was dissuaded by the United States from signing the decree because the United States was concerned that the downing of the civilian aircraft could expose the United States government and companies to lawsuits.
In April 2001 when a Peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed a Peruvian missionary and her children the United States reduced its previous support for the operation targeting drug-running aircraft.
Victim's relatives sued the US government and won a settlement with the US government for providing intelligence and technical support to the operation.
A US State Department official stated --
There are certain conditions under which US law may forbid assistance to countries that implement the law that was shot down.
The US agreed with Brazil's assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is very serious and increasing.
The US Government is consulting with the Brazilian Government on Brazilian law provisions.
Brazilian Defense Minister Jose Viegas stated that Brazil encountered difficulties in securing US support for the plan but recent bilateral talks have led to certainty that the Brazilian government will accept the decree without exposing Brazil to commercial sanctions.
Brazilian officials expressed hope that the US would endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
The US is scheduled to provide 10 million dollars of drug and law enforcement aid to Brazil in 2004.
Former Air Force chief and current director of the Air Institute at Estacio de Sa University in Rio de Janeiro General Mauro Jose Miranda Gandra stated that the government's courage in taking the measures is a courageous step but the impact may be more political than practical due to restrictions imposed by the Brazilian government.
Brazilian officials stated that the policy may not apply against aircraft with children on board.
Viegas stated that limits are necessary.
Gandra stated that the provision undermined the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug smuggling aircraft carrying children and therefore introduced the possibility of kidnapped children being used as human shields.
Viegas stated in an interview in Brasilia that the government is using laws more powerfully to dissuade drug traffickers who previously entered Brazilian airspace feeling that the Air Force did not pose a threat.
The government's actions were prompted by the deteriorating public security situation of increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro in particular.
Drug gangs in Rio de Janeiro have more firepower than the police, have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close.
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stated in a 2003 foreign correspondent interview that --
The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security.
Some drug-running aircraft pilots felt so confidently immune to retribution they made obscene gestures at the Brazilian Air Force pilots being pursued.
The law is in question because Brazil prohibits the death penalty as punishment for criminal acts.
Some legal experts and other commentators have stated that contrary to the government's claims, the statute amounts to de facto execution of drug traffickers.
The daily newspaper O Estado de Sao Paolo stated in an editorial the week of 18 July 2004 to 24 July 2004 that extreme measures raise ethical and juridical problems that exceed any potential benefits.
The penalty was applied extrajudicially through administrative decisions of the Air Force commanders.
These people are gaining life and death power over crew members and non-regular flyers.
Brazil inaugurated the 1.4 billion dollar SIVAM radar system in 2002 that will allow the Government to monitor air activity for the first time throughout the expansive Amazon region.
The system uses United States technology.
Illegal flying declined initially by 30 percent due to concerns about improved tracking capabilities among traffickers, but subsequently reaccelerated.
Brazil recorded 4128 unauthorised flights in 2003.
Some of these flights were innocently violated by Amazon ranchers flying between plantations.
Viegas stated that deliberate violations of Brazilian airspace by drug smugglers apparently aware of the Government's inability to retaliate has increased significantly.
In April 2001 Rio de Janeiro's most notorious drug dealer boss Fernandinho Beira-Mar was captured in Colombia in a drug-gun pipeline involving left-wing guerrillas.
The northern Amazon corridor of Brazil has become an increasingly busy and essential route in the global drug trade and has been used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
Colombia to Suriname is one of the most important routes for drug and gun smuggling from Europe across the northern tier of the Amazon.
Colombia is the only country currently with a policy of targeting aircraft trafficking drugs.
Colombia is a source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the United States.

International; weapons; leader; military
Venezuela and its domestic critics are worried about the Venezuelan president's weapons deals with Russia, curbing military cooperation with the United States and planning training for as many as 2 million Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible superpower invasion.
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's weapons deals, curbing of military cooperation with Russia and plans to train as many as two million civilians to repel a possible invasion by imperialist superpowers have worried the United States and domestic Chavez critics about the plans of former military officers of the left.
Chavez insists the move is purely defensive and bears the overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect Venezuela from nations that might want to take control of Venezuela.
Venezuela is the largest petroleum producer in South America.
Domestic opponents of Chavez scoff at the idea of a US invasion of Venezuela ever and truly charge that Chavez intends to arm a huge cadre of loyal reservists to protect him from any internal uprisings and pose a militarized counterweight to US influence in Latin America.
Cuban leader Fidel Castro was a major ally of Chavez and the two grew closer.
Chavez's detractors in the US government say Chavez's arm purchases and the indoctrination of civilian militias are even more troublesome as part of a strategy to restructure Venezuela's democracy with a militarized socialist image in the Cuban style that has fomented leftist revolutions throughout South America.
US military strategists say they are increasingly concerned that the radical moves inspired by Chavez could foment such a revolution.
The political mainstream in Latin America has shifted leftward since the late 1990s.
This shift leftward is largely a reaction to the perceived failure of free market economics.
Leftists were elected to lead Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador and Venezuela.
Chavez supporters at home counter that the United States has a century-long history of open and covert armed intervention in Latin America's domestic politics and say that the United States has no right to question Venezuela's defense preparations.
Carlos Roque Espinoza Leon said that the Venezuelan people have never asked what the US marines would do.
Espinoza Leon is a pro-Chavez defense specialist in Venezuela's serving National Assembly.
Espinoza said Peru has 500,000 rifles and no one has said anything.
Espinoza said no one is complaining that Colombia is the most militarily oriented country in Latin America.
Espinoza said that the US history is full of aggression in Latin America.
Espinoza said the Venezuelans must do whatever necessary to protect Venezuela.
Chavez famously said that the so-called Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela was peaceful but armed.
Chavez was elected for the first time in 1998 and his popularity rating in an independent poll by Datanalisis was 71%.
Venezuelan military analyst Alberto Garrido said in Russia, China and Iran that Chavez is looking to his allies to promote a multipolar world to counter the US dominance and encourage grass-root movements in Latin America to throw off the US government's influence.
Farmer Lorenzo Campos from Anzoategui state in northern Venezuela is being trained as a reservist.
Campos said the Venezuelans want the world to know that they are not prepared to attack anyone and that Venezuela is protected by mission.
In May 2005 Chavez's government announced details of a 1860 million dollar deal with a Russian firm to purchase 100,000 AK-103 assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition each and a technology transfer to Venezuela for the manufacture of the rifles.
The deal worked out at $186.22 per rifle.
This price is considerably less than the $825-850 price for the same weapons ordered by US mail.
The Government of Venezuela also intends to buy 10 helicopters from Russia, 10 transport planes from Spain and 6 naval craft from Russia.
Venezuelan officials said the government is negotiating with Brazil to buy around 24 air support and training planes.
Chavez insisted and even his staunchest critics here agree that the purchase is essential to updating the military's decades-old weaponry such as the FAL rifles from Belgium.
Retired General Fernando Ochoa Antich said it was exaggerated to say Chavez was engaged in the arms buildup.
Ochoa was defense minister in 1992 when then-Lt. Col. Chavez launched a failed coup.
Ochoa stated that Venezuela has not purchased arms in 25 years and said Chavez has not aggressively bought weapons with threats to his neighbors.
Ochoa said Venezuela has never before bought arms from Russia and suggested Chavez buy arms to become independent of the US.
Ochoa asked why Chavez bought the rifle caliber popular as a subversive force in Latin America and stated that Chavez's political support for radical leftist moves made him a continental menace.
The US Pentagon has openly questioned what Chavez would do with the old FAL rifle and whether Chavez could share weapons or ammunition with the guerrilla forces in Latin America.
The US government has provided no evidence that Chavez has armed or funded the leftist insurgency.
Military analysts and specialists in Colombia's FARC guerrillas say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and are not interested in old Belgian rifles or Chavez's assistance.
A 2003 US Defense Intelligence Agency study reported that more than half of the weapons marked by foreign military seized by Colombian guerrillas from 1998 to 2001 originated in Venezuela.
Implying that corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military could be aiding the guerrillas.
The new military and civilian reservist training, in the mind of critics, may cause more distress to Chavez' domestic opponents.
Earlier in 2005, Chavez had so called for the revolutionary units to start preparing the public for resistance against the superpowers, and said that the first step in resisting the superpowers would be training 100,000 to 200,000 volunteers to back up the active duty armed forces in the years to come.
Military analysts estimate that Venezuela's active duty armed forces number 83000.
People's defense units were created in neighborhoods, state companies and the Free University established under Chavez and report directly to the President.
The government insisted the reserve support the armed forces and not act as the fifth column against a possible coup against Chavez.
Espinoza said the reserve should not be used for troops that would shock any political party and that in a civil war each person would decide which side to take.
General Julio Ramon Quintero Viloria is the reserve commander.
In an interview Quintero said the armed forces hope to train 50,000 civilians over the course of 20 weekends in the second half of 2005 and could train 300,000 more in 2006.
Quintero said the Venezuelans do not want the colony of any empire and must be ready for any possibility.
In June 2005 100,000 reservists and the Venezuelan navy engaged in a massive war game to repel an invading stronger country.
In June 2005 40 state oil company employees and 1200 soldiers participated in a similar exercise.
The pro-Chavez circles here have warned against asymmetric warfare.
Unsymmetrical warfare is a term coined by the US military strategists to describe a conflict in which the combatants are not equally divided and the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
The US government has given Colombia the most military aid of 3.3 billion dollars in the past 5 years.
Chavez loyalists fear the US government may instigate a proxy war between Colombia and Venezuela to oust Chavez and control the oil from Venezuela.
In an interview a senior US official dismissed the notion that the US government wants to invade Venezuela as completely and utterly absurd.
Officials said the Chavez side wishes to make a negative relationship because the political calculation of the Chavez side is that Mr. Chavez will reach power through constant confrontation with the US.
Another development that has troubled the United States is Chavez's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises.
The US military has had a cooperation office at the Venezuelan fort for 50 years.
Chavez shut it down in 2004.
5 US military trainees and students participating in exchange programs were ordered to leave the country in April 2005.
Analysts say Chavez is likely trying to indoctrinate his public and armed forces.
Analysts say there is no proof that Chavez used those forces to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere.

The North Korean government may be preparing to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step towards disabling the reactor by December 2007.
On 18 June 2007 Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill stated that the North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step toward disabling the reactor by December 2007.
Hill is the United States head negotiator for North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
Hill stated that stalled efforts to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend of 16-17 June 2007 when International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors visited on an invitation from Pyongyang officials for talks on verification and monitoring of the shutdown.
Following his talks with Chinese negotiator Wu Dawei Hill stated that a shutdown was long anticipated.
Hill stated that the shutdown could happen within weeks but not months.
The Associated Press reported in Vienna, Austria that the IAEA stated on 18 June 2007 that a team will visit Pyongyang the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which inspectors will verify the shutdown.
Hill stated that IAEA inspectors have held talks with Pyongyang officials regarding the sealing of the reactor including the installation of a television monitor at the site.
North Korean officials refused to proceed with an agreement to begin decommissioning the Yongbyon reactor in February 2007 until funds worth 25 million dollars held in a Macao bank linked account were transferred to North Korea.
The money was frozen after United States officials accused Banco Delta Asia of complicity in financial crime in North Korea.
The funds were wired to the New York Federal Reserve Bank on 14 June 2007 after months of disagreement over the method of return.
The funds were supposed to be sent to Russia's Central Bank before being transferred to a North Korean commercial bank account controlled by the North Korean government.
Hill stated that the week of 17 June 2007 there will be talks with disarmament negotiators from Russia, South Korea and Japan on steps to recoup some of the time lost in organizing the financial transfer.
The discussion also involved setting a timetable for the six nations to resume arms control talks.
Under the agreement reached in February 2007 North Korean officials pledged to shut down the Yongbyon reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a shipment of 50,000 tons of fuel oil.
In the next phase of the agreement North Korean officials will declare all nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for a further 950,000 tons of fuel oil.
Hill stated that the next phase of the agreement could technically be concluded by December 2007.

A leading arms control expert has criticized the new nuclear activity plans released by Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency of the U.N. as ineffective and dangerous.
Iran and the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency released plans on August 27, 2007 to resolve the issue by December 2007.
The issue has remained unresolved for 4 years.
The plan meant to allay suspicions of Iran's past nuclear activities.
An agency official stated that the plan was a breakthrough.
20070828 Iranian President Mahmoud ahmadinejad stated at a news conference in Tehran --
The investigation into Iran's nuclear activities is now closed.
None of the other members of the International Atomic Energy Agency are cooperating as well as Iran.
Iran is a nuclear nation.
Iran has a nuclear fuel cycle.
Iran has not succumbed to international pressure to curb its nuclear project.
Iran's nuclear project is for peaceful purposes.
The United States and some European nations believe Iran's nuclear project is to make nuclear weapons.
Several Western governments and leading arms control experts have stated that Iran is attempting to avoid further U.N. Security Council sanctions.
Western governments include the United States and France.
Government and experts believe Iran is making an attempt.
The arms control process is slow.
Answering questions about past violations of the treaty by Iran would be avoided.
President of the Institute for Science and International Security David Albright stated --
Iran's claims are unverifiable.
The International Atomic Energy Agency does not have access to people, documents and sites.
The International Atomic Energy Agency would lose the right to ask further questions in the future.
Unusual developments set a bad precedent.
The International Atomic Energy Agency may have been tricked by its eagerness for the deal.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plan announced --
Iran has resolved the question of its past plutonium experiments without explaining how.
Senior Fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies Mark Fitzpatrick stated --
The International Atomic Energy Agency's plan is superficial.
The International Atomic Energy Agency's plans for the negotiations drew out negotiations for many months.
The International Atomic Energy Agency's plans could leave Iran with incomplete and misleading answers.
The International Institute for Strategic Studies is located in London.
Plutonium is a material that could be used to make a nuclear weapon.
The Institute for Science and International Security is a private research organization located in Washington.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is based in Vienna.

A list from the Nuclear Suppliers Group shows that approximately 75 countries have denied Iran the purchase of nuclear-related materials since 1998 due to suspicions that the material could be used to build a bomb.
A list from the Nuclear Suppliers Group shows that approximately 75 countries have denied Iran the purchase of nuclear-related materials since 1998 due to suspicions that the material could be used to build a bomb.
The 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group is an offshoot of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and is charged with monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes is not directed towards military use.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group is composed of technologically advanced countries.
According to the Nuclear Suppliers Group mission statement countries will act on an individual basis to block trade that violates export controls devised to maintain international cooperation in peaceful use of nuclear energy.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group has no enforcement power beyond notifying companies of violations of its guidelines.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group keeps the data private and meets in large secret.
Most of the purchase denials have occurred since 2002 and are the result of the intervention of members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
Diplomats from countries interested in exposing the extent of Iran's efforts to acquire so-called items that could be converted into weapons production have availed themselves of trade denial lists.
The list was availble subject to identification of diplomats and countries.
The list named companies from Australia, Finland, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and Iran preventing the deals from being carried out because the items being sold were suspected of being military useful.
Nickel powder, petrochemical plant components, compressors, furnaces, steel flanges and fittings, electron microscopes, radiometric ore sorting machines, valves and tubing, lasers, rotary drilling rigs, mass spectrometers and nitrogen production plants are among items on the list that have been offered to sell on the block.
Iran's government and atomic energy organization, power and engineering companies, petrochemical and oil-refining companies, gas companies, aircraft industry, schools and universities, engine manufacturing companies, mineral research centers, helicopter support companies and plasma physics centers are among Iran's end-use organizations.
Diplomats stated that the 75 denials represent only the actions of 7 of the 45 member states.
Diplomats stated that the actual number of denials of sales of dual-use products to Iran is probably much higher than that.
Western diplomats stated that the government in Tehran is using a front company to receive and convert technology for weapons production undetected as the standoff with Iran continues over Iran's nuclear program.
Iran has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but is not a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

Iranian Fars news agency stated that hundreds of Shiite-related websites had been defaced or blocked by hackers known as XP.
The defaced and blocked websites included Iraq's official website of Shiite leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.
XP stated on the defaced website that any website containing material contrary to Sunni teachings had been hacked.
Iraq's religious leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani's official website was defaced and blocked in a sectarian-motivated cyber attack on religiously-related sites.
It is unclear whether the attacks began on September 18, 2008 or the morning of September 19, 2008.
Al-Sistani's website went offline the evening of 19 September 2008.
Another website relating to one of Al-Sistani's religious organizations - www.al-shia.com - was also affected.
The alternative address www.sistani.com is still operational.
Iran's Fars news agency stated that on 18 and 19 September 2008 XP blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite-related sites.
The hacking claims and Iran's assertion that XP is based in the United Arab Emirates cannot be independently verified.
On 19 September 2008 several Iranian news sites stated that many of the attacked web sites relating to Shiites and Iran were running normally again.
A statement signed by XP was posted on Al-Sistani's web site's home page and stated that the attacks targeted Sunni Muslims.
According to the statement --
XP has carried out similar attacks on other Shiite sites in the Persian Gulf and Iraq.
XP erased the site as they had done with other Rafidha sites.
Rafidha means reject and is an insult used by Sunni extremists to describe Shiites.
Al-Sistani promoted sexual deviance and the Iranian agenda in Iraq as a child.
Any website with material contrary to Sunni teachings will be punished.
The statement also consisted of a YouTube video clip of American comedian Bill Maher ridiculing Al-Sistani's fatwa on the permissibility of certain sexual intercourse positions for married couples.
The ayatollah's office in Najaf declined to comment on the cyber attacks.
The Fars reported that counterattacks were carried out against 2 major Wahhabi web sites belonging to the puritanical strain of Sunni Islam that dominates in Saudi Arabia.

Somali pirates hijacking a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large arms cargo have approached a deal for the release of the ship.
Questions arose regarding the shipment of arms en route to Kenya and the possible clandestine dealing of arms between Kenya and South Sudan.
On 8 October 2008 maritime officials and people associated with Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large arms cargo on 25 September 2008 stated that the pirates may soon collect their ransom.
After a difficult negotiation likened by several people involved in bazaar-style haggling, the parties closed with a deal reached in which millions of dollars would be paid to the pirates and the ship would be freed.
Ahmed Omar of Xarardheere in Somalia stated that the pirates had agreed to pay a ransom of approximately 8 million U.S. dollars to the ship's owners and that the ship could be freed on 081008 or 081009.
Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on Somalia's coast.
A maritime official in Kenya stated that critical details have not yet been agreed upon.
One such detail involves the pirates' request for a guarantee that the armada of US warships currently encircling the pirates will not arrest or attack them.
A Kenyan maritime official stated anonymously that such negotiations are complex and involve more than the financial aspects.
On 8 October 2008 officials stated that there had been progress and that the parties were approaching an agreement.
The pirates initially requested 35 million U.S. dollars and then reduced it to 20 million U.S. dollars.
The pirates have consistently expressed their willingness to negotiate financial figures.
More than 25 ships were hijacked off Somalia's coast in 2008 for ransoms typically between 1 and 2 million Somali dollars.
Pirates on board the Ukrainian ship stated that the ship, its cargo aboard and the 20 sailors on board would be released upon receipt of payment in United States dollars or preferentially a 100 dollar bill.
The question is which country was the original destination of the arms shipped on board the Ukrainian ship.
Shortly after the freighter was hijacked on September 25, 2008 Kenya's government claimed the weapons on board were being shipped to Kenya's military.
The ship was en route to Kenya's main port of Mombasa.
The weapons on board the ship included 33 T-72 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition.
Evidence of weapons in a clandestine arms deal between Kenya and the South Sudanese separatist region emerged subsequently.
The deal is most likely to remain secret unless the pirates hijack the ship and begin speaking to the media via satellite phone.
Ukrainian officials were adamant in denying any wrongdoing.
Ukrainian diplomat in Kenya Oleh Belokolos stated --
Ukraine has not supplied any armaments to the South Sudanese Government or has no plans to do so.
All appropriate paperwork will be validated.
Ukraine abides by all United Nations rules and arms control agreements.
Ukraine inherited an enormous stockpile of weaponry after the collapse of the Soviet Union and is now in a major arms deal.
Kenya's dealings with Ukraine are considered suspicious because Kenya mainly relies on the United Kingdom and other western countries for heavy weapons supplies.
Kenyan politicians demanded answers and called for the examination of the situation by several commissions.
Southern Sudan is an autonomous region that is currently increasing its military and uses Soviet-designed tanks.
The United States military stated that it was a priority to ensure the weapons were not unloaded from ships and sold to Islamist insurgents in Somalia.
Pirates denied interest in weapons and claimed they were unaware tanks were part of the cargo when they hijacked the ship.
Pirate spokesman Sugule Ali stated in an interview last week that the pirates' sole interest in the deal was money.

Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban have cut back poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing the insurgency.
Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban have cut back poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing the insurgency.
Costa said this to reporters last week as the U.N. Drug Office prepared to release its latest survey on Afghanistan's opium crop.
The survey showed poppy cultivation has retreated much of Afghanistan and has been concentrated overwhelmingly in 7 of the 34 provinces where the insurgency remains strong, mostly in the south.
The survey was issued on November 27, 2008.
The United Nations found that the result was a reduction of 19% in the amount of land devoted to opium in Afghanistan while total tonnage of opium produced dropped just 6 percent.
The study stated that high output per acre is attributed to a good growing season in the south.
The southern region is an heavily irrigated area where the Taliban maintain a strong presence in five provinces and have systematically encouraged opium cultivation in order to finance their insurgency for several years.
The U.N. estimates the insurgents made as much as 300 million dollars from the opium trade last year.
Costa said a lot of the war effort could be funded with between two and three billion dollars.
The Taliban produce far more opium than the world demand due to successive bumper crops of three years.
Costa said the result would be a glut that would depress prices by approximately 20 percent.
Costa said that the fact that prices have already collapsed is evidence that the Taliban, drug lords and even some farmers are stockpiling opium.
The increased amounts are also being processed in Afghanistan.
Costa added that the insurgents held significant amounts of opium.
Costa said the surplus was as much as 11000 tons, equal to twice the world demand of three years ago, and threatened the devaluation of their stockpile.
The United Nations found that Afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008.
The world demand is estimated to be about 4400 tons per year.
This year the Taliban have taken a passive stance on cultivation and have less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppies.
This then supports the current price.
Costa is an Italian diplomat who served for six years at the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.

On 06 October 2001 The Citizen newspaper stated that it was illegal for South Africans to be involved in mercenary activities or render assistance to foreign military inside or outside South Africa.
The Citizen newspaper stated that on 5 October 2001 the South African Foreign Ministry announced that the Government of South Africa would impose a ban on mercenary activities following reports that 1,000 Muslim military trainees had enlisted to leave South Africa for Afghanistan to fight the Taliban against the United States.
The report claimed that Muslims Against Illegitimate Leaders (MAIL) claims that 1000s of military-trained Muslims have volunteered their services and received the backing of local businessmen.
The report claimed that over 18 years all 1000 Muslim men had been in military training.
Muslims Against Illegitimate Leaders is a Cape Town-based group.
The Muslim Judicial Council refuted the report.
The South African Foreign Ministry stated that South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act prohibits the recruitment of people inside or outside South Africa for mercenary or foreign military assistance.
The South African Foreign Military Assistance Act means that unless granted permission by the National Conventional Arms Control Committee, people are not allowed to offer military assistance to any state, state organ or group of other countries.
South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act means that foreign military assistance can only be rendered in accordance with agreements approved by the National Conventional Arms Control Committee.
The South African Foreign Ministry stated that any person found to be violating South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act or any person who fails to receive permission to participate in foreign military activities may be prosecuted for the violation or failure and sentenced to a fine, imprisonment or both.

20020701 former Peruvian spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos was convicted of illegally taking control of the National Intelligence Service while only supposed to advise the spy agency under ex-President Alberto Fujimori.
Montesinos was sentenced to 9 years and 4 months in prison for abuse of authority.
The sentence also ordered Montesinos to pay a 3 million dollar fine plus state compensation.
Anti-corruption judge Saul Pena stated that Montesinos admitted to charges of abuse of authority.
This is the first ruling in more than 50 charges against Montesinos including corruption, drug trafficking, dealing in illegal arms and human rights violations.
Montesinos is alleged to run a network of bribery.
Leaked videotapes showed Montesinos bribing congressmen to switch to the government party and triggered events that culminated in Fujimori's resignation in November 2000.
Fujimori has been accused of duty dereliction and embezzlement and has been imposed exile in Japan since resigning in order to avoid legal actions by Peruvian authorities through the protection of dual nationality.
Montesinos fled to Peru in October 2000 but was captured in Venezuela on June 23, 2001.
Montesinos heard the sentence at the Callao Naval Base where he has been imprisoned since 2001.
Montesinos stated that he would consult defense lawyers regarding his appeal.

Hong Kong police are trying to prevent the Triad or transnational criminal syndicates from engaging in criminal activities.
Hong Kong police recently smashed a transnational theft syndicate specializing in exploiting youngster to commit various crimes, a cross-border criminal syndicate, and a local Triad gang.
According to the opinion of the Oriental Daily News, within a short period of 3 weeks, Hong Kong police efforts to cut down 5 of so-called leaders of the Triad branches or of district teams demonstrates the determination of the police to eradicate criminal activities.
The Hong Kong police have recently been working closely with the Public Security Bureau in Guangdong for intelligence exchanges and have carried out raids and operations in the series.
The Hong Kong police launched a crackdown on the Triad activities from 18 July 2002 to 24 July 2002 including drug trafficking, illegal arms possession, theft, burglary, robbery, sales of pirate and obscene records, duty-free cigarettes and trafficking in dangerous drugs.
Police reported dispatching over 100 staff on 020724 to storm a propitiate dance and wine party organized at a disco in Mongkok, Kowloon to settle some disputes between two Triad groups.
Police eventually arrested 3 branch leaders and 14 core members of the Triad.
Police sources confirmed to the Xinhua News Agency on 25 July 2002 that all 17 people arrested were still detained for questioning.
A Hong Kong police source was quoted as saying that the operation succeeded in netting all 17 people as a result of police efforts to infiltrate the relevant gangs here.
Police sources also intimated that the Hong Kong police crackdown on other Triad gangs would follow more.
Hong Kong police's efforts to fight off organized criminals involve active cooperation with police in mainland China and other regions.
The so-called target conference of the International Drug Enforcement Conference in the Far East was held in Hong Kong earlier in July 2002.
Hong Kong was chosen to host the event following a decision by IDEC at a meeting held in Bolivia in February 2002.
Some 42 senior anti-narcotic officers from mainland China, Hong Kong, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United States met.
A Hong Kong police internal news letter recently reported that the aim of the conference is to provide a flexible and forward-thinking environment for information sharing and positive action against organized transnational drug traffickers.
The intelligence exchanges between Hong Kong and mainland Chinese police are particularly intense.
A delegation of 11 members of mainland China's National Narcotics Control Commission recently visited Hong Kong to study how Hong Kong police enforce their anti-narcotic laws.
The team of 11 people was chaired by Chen Cunyi, deputy director of the Bureau of Narcotics Control of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, briefed by Hong Kong police on enforcement actions being carried out in Hong Kong, and led by Ip Lau Chuen, head of the city's Narcotics Bureau.
Hong Kong police also exchanged mutual concerns with China's National Narcotics Control Commission and discussed a number of issues including anti-drug trafficking and money laundering investigations.
The mainland party closed their visit after meeting Hong Kong Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Crime Yam Tat Wing and discussing further proposals for cooperation to combat cross-border drug trafficking activities.

A Peruvian military document disclosed the links between Montesinos and drug trafficking as the former head of intelligence.
A document signed by a high-ranking former Peruvian army officer and disclosed on 25 July 2002 mentions drug trafficking links and may further compromise the situation of former head of Peru's National Intelligence Service Vladimiro Montesinos.
According to a front page story in Peru's national newspaper El Comercio, Montesinos may have authorized drug dealing by military leaders in Alto Huallaga in order to find leaders of the rebel group the Shinning Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
Alto Huallaga is located northeast of the capital Lima.
The story is based on the final report from the Attorney General's Office.
The Attorney General's Office report collected the accused documents handed over by an unnamed Peruvian army general.
El Comercio newspaper said that in 1992 the Government under then President Alberto Fujimori put into effect the Scorpion intelligence operation to fight terrorism and drug trafficking in the Amazon.
Several of the planned Scorpion agents infiltrated the group to gather information on who was commanding the main rebels and drug traffickers.
Additional orders for the transportation of cocaine to cover the agents were also issued.
Montesinos is a close adviser to former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.
Fujimori resigned in November over the bribery scandal and is now in prison in Lima for connections to the alleged scandal.

French Foreign Minister characterizes recent raids against the People's Mujahedeen in Paris as part of fight against terrorism.
French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said on June 3, 2003 that the Government of France considers cracking down on Iran's armed opposition People's Mujahedeen as part of an operation against terrorism.
De Villepin said on France Info radio that the People's Mujahedeen has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks in Iran and that this dimension of terrorism cannot be hidden.
De Villepin said the arrests were a justice decision and there was no diplomatic factor in these affairs.
De Villepin said the French have taken strict justice-based actions with the determination to do all they can to fight terrorism.
On 22 June 2003 French police raided the headquarters of the People's Mujahedeen northwest of Paris.
The People's Mujahedeen accused French authorities of being part of a deal with the Iranian government to carry out the operation.
The Government of Iran denies this claim.
The Mujahedeen's 17 members are now the subject of judicial investigations over alleged links to terrorist organizations and funding of terrorist activities.
Some 160 people were initially detained as police cracked down on over 10 of the People's Mujahedeen's locations in France.
During the police raids a Paris map marked out with streets related to the United States embassy was seized along with bulletproof jackets, transmission equipment, more than 200 computers and about 9 million United States cash dollars.
The People's Mujahedeen has been classified by the United States, the European Union and Iran as a terrorist organization.
The People's Mujahedeen was formed in the 1960s by young college educated Iranians and has been described as an Islamist leftist organization.
The People's Mujahedeen staged terrorist attacks inside Iran in the 1970s and killed several US military personnel and civilians working in defense projects in Teheran.
The People's Mujahedeen was part of a broad coalition initially supporting the Iranian Revolution and participating in the 1979 takeover of the US embassy in Teheran.
The People's Mujahedeen and the Government have fallen out and the People's Mujahedeen has been building military and political bases in Europe since the 1980s.
In recent years the People's Mujahedeen has claimed responsibility for assassinating several Iranian regime figures.
These assassinations include former director of Evin Prison in Teheran Assodalah Ladjevardi in August 1998 and former Iranian Army chief General Ali Sayad Chirazi in April 1999.
