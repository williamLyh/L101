Support the thread starter resolutely. I replied with a poem.
Pledge to fight to the death to defend the Diaoyu Islands and its related islands.
The fishing boats were bumped out of the fleet by evil little Japanese ghosts stirring up trouble and unrest. They showed their wolfish appearance again, with the hearts of the thieves and the forms of arrogance.
Never go back to that time when we appeared humiliated when we signed the treaty. China is strong! Be sharp with the sword and shine with the knife! Let us bury the approaching enemy!

Resolutely, I agree with the analysis of the thread starter, I would like to be Hua Mulan to protect our homes, defend our homeland, spread the prestige of our country, and pledge to fight to the death to defend our national dignity, if it really comes to war.
I very much wish to be born during that passionate, upsurge Long March of Mao Zedong, to lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguish all the wrongdoers of China, and spread our dragon's prestige.
Why are we tolerating Japan?
Fellow Citizens.
Hello everyone, we all know about the September 18th, but now Japan is again premeditatingly planning another incident in the sea, like the Lugou Bridge in the sea.
Surprisely, Japan has defied the strong condemnation of the whole world, and has openly invaded our country's sacred territory (Diaoyu Islands).
The Diaoyu Islands have always belonged to China, as we all know. However, for historical reasons, the Diaoyu Islands have become the object of controversy.
As a fellow citizen, I would say we are who we are, and why the need for negotiations? Japan went even further, wanting to create the facts of the occupation. Can we allow this? Absolutely not.
Fellow Citizens, Japan's militarism brought a grave disaster to the Asian people.
China especially has suffered from Japan's ravages for several decades.
In the Northeast, the Japanese military unit 731 has been cruelly experimenting on the lives of Chinese, Koreans and other countries through extremely brutal methods ; the bloody battles in Hengyang and Changsha have bare the bones of the dead for over 1000 kilometers, and have killed everything off ; the Nanjing Massacre has added an ever - never - fading layer of blood to the ancient capital.
There are too many instances of heinous crimes committed by Japan in China, cited in the instance, which are difficult to record without all the bamboo strips being exhausted, fellow citizens.
Just like those one billion souls who have lost their lives wandered over to the Pacific Ocean and found it difficult to rest in peace.
So when we turn to this page in history and read it, all those who experienced that era will still remember it in vivid. Even our younger generation will also cry tears of tears streaming down our cheek, and our blood will boil with indignation.
Actually, Japan wants to reverse the verdict on its history of aggression, so they are waking up fellow citizens and Chinese people in Asia.
We have to go face to face with this 100 years of shame, it is a pain for us to look back at this shameful 100 years. Let's create and choose history, even if it does not resolve the issues of history.
The reason we are not afraid is because we are responsible. Even though the territory is small, it is related to matters of dignity, and the interests of the country and the nation guarantee honor regardless of how the wind and the clouds change. We cannot let our native land be separated, no matter how scarred and wounded it is.
As a fellow citizen of the Chinese nation, the 21st century is a time when we are beset by difficulties from the inside but pressed from the outside, and we face many challenges.
How should we go about the Taiwan issue, the Tibet issue, the South China Sea issue, the surrounding environment, the foreign forces that are aggressive towards China?
What do I say fellow citizens, please look at the world map, the crescent-shaped encirclement is suppressing our breath, strangling our development and coveting our national territory.
We don't want to make enemies, but we don't want to be afraid of them either. We don't want war, but we aren't afraid of it.
We must urgently arrange arms and strengthen all military forces, land, sea and air.
The Chinese nation has been several thousand years in the making, but has never had the ambition to expand its territory outward.
We follow a foreign security strategy philosophy that applies benevolence and virtue and does not impose what we do not want on others.
The tolerance and liberalism of the country is like that of the individual, which means we must insist on not hurting others in order to avoid hurting others.
Tolerance is certainly not fear and sincerity does not have to be cowardice.
Exempting Japan from war repairs caused by World War II served as a means of benevolence.
As a fellow citizen of the People's Heroes Monument, I would say that the People's Heroes Monument is a condensed history of the Chinese nation that is striving for continuous improvement.
The solemn posture represented a sacred expectation of peace.
My memory strings of thoughts are occasionally agitated by the stirring up of many heroic and tragic scenes of shining spears and armored horses in my mind.
The thought of integrity goes to that yellow historical page, like I saw in the hundreds of years when Kangxi, the famous ruler of the generation, was alone in his audience hall, contemplating how to achieve unification of the territories, and Abraham Lincoln, the former U.S. president, wandered alone in the great hall, thinking about the integrity of the Union.
As much as we want development and peace in the world, forgetting about war is certainly dangerous to peace in the world. As a fellow citizen, I would say that we must never exercise forbearance blind, but the Boxer Protocol has aggravated the poverty and backwardness of China in modern times. Failing behind leads to bullying.
Without a strong foundation, how will peace come?
We need to focus on national defense education, build up a great wall at the heart of 1.3 billion people, and establish a full range of systems capable of attacking and defending the nation.
We should strengthen the forces that can engage in our ultra-long-range attacks and greatly improve combat capability in all aerospace from a great distance and depth. Increase investment and construction in defense industries, accelerate modernization and internationalization of military equipment, and establish high-tech elite high-quality divisions on the premise that you avoid influencing national economic development. Best defense is attack.
The battle horn is about to sound and people are already fully equipped and ready to go.
We accomplish nothing without the support of the people, but we are all powerful with the support of the people.
Time to say no to other people, fellow citizens. That's what we have to achieve.
First, establish a guarantee fund, improve work environment and work mechanisms, and recruit back to China the hundreds of thousands of IT professionals who have emigrated from the United States and around the world and are lingering in the United States and around the world.
2. Creating a few battle groups with nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
3. Manufacturing 5000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds.
4. accelerating research and deployment of high-speed ICBMs with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles and the ability to break missile defenses.
5. Resumption of nuclear experiments and establishment of a military force in space.
6. Retaining 1000s of nuclear bombs equivalent to a million tons of trinitrotoluene and installing nuclear warheads on all short- and middle-range missiles when necessary.
7. Retaining 30 strategic nuclear submarines capable of inflicting 3 devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy.
8. Abandon your commitment not to use nuclear weapons first.
9) The right to pre-emptive strike is retained when national security is in threat.
As fellow citizens, we can strive to be strong only if we are confident in ourselves and improve ourselves. Qin Shi Huang unified China. Zheng Chenggong recovered Taiwan. We must carry on with the far-seeing, insight and strong will of our predecessors.
Now that piece of land that trembleeth far from the embrace of the motherland, and moans and calls, let us carry forward, fellow citizens, with courage, carrying forward the wishes of the previous generals that have not been fulfilled.
When I read about history, my heaviness and anger simmers in my heart as I am concerned about my nation. However, I am willing to serve our country voluntarily for the sake of the motherland's prosperity and splendid glory once again, and even if I die, I will not regret having been born in a cloth gown and included among the common people. To show my sincere patriotic heart to heaven is adequate.
I composed the poem here in the classical form of ci to voice my heart's aspirations.
Paint your lips deep red.
Protect the Diaoyu Islands.
We have bitterly lost our island, the Ryukyu Islands.
How can we allow the Diaoyu Islands to fall to other countries?
100 years of vicissitude.
The smoke and cloud chased the flying wave.
The youngest brother is still a tender youth.
wandered in all directions and was born a seal.
Looking over the flag.
We brandished our weapons and crossed to the east.
Let the horses drink in the Pacific Ocean.

The other article is titled "My dream book for my Taiwanese compatriots" and "The need to build a memorial museum or a temple for the Chinese national heroes" - how many times do we tolerate it when a country never beg to be in the Olympics but expects to be in the Olympics? When we forget about the hardship of history, there will be more and more difficult histories. How many times do we tolerate the US? According to Google, they have no right to make irresponsible remarks against the US. Japan deserves the bouquet presented by the strong anti-bombs Ban Ki-Moon in Hiroshima. Taiwan is only one nation and one culture, the state can decline over the development of sports. Is it a wealthy country and strong people, or a wealthy country and awealthy official and a poor person? Ren Zhiqiang shut his filthy mouth - hateful housing prices and pityable people.
Why didn't we fight the little Japan?
What are the Chinese still tolerant of?
They even ride on our heads.
Do the Chinese still do this with a gut?
We should tell the whole world that others cannot bully China at will.
Time to show our strength! China has been too calm for too long.
Currently, all our citizens' lives are too carefree. The officials are too extravagant.
We already have no cohesion now. China needs to start a war. A slap in the face of countries that follow the United States rear.
Let them know that the US is not a panacea. If we win, we can increase China's influence. If we lose, we can clean out incompetent bureaucrats and make the trash get out. Let China have new blood and update. Let China get up.
China, go.
I suggest that China strengthen its guard of the Diaoyu Islands, guard the Diaoyu Islands every day, protect the fishermen and our country's sovereignty, and if Japan dare to invade our territory by military force, regardless of the cost, we will fight a small scale war to defend ourselves. China cannot lose.
We need shows in life, but it's really p. to show who you are and be embraced by someone.
I just passed by.
This is like the whole society, including the stars.
Damn, not sexy.
It's totally unacceptable.
Agreed that they are just cheap entertainers. However, their reputation in feudal China makes somewhat sense.
Their lives look glorious.
Group of 9 professions
Life is hard.
Shocking.
That's normal, and the whore is always heartless and the performer is never righteous.
They want the money, not the face.
Look for the wolf near Ms. Fan with glasses. You know the actors have to drink with him, not be forced out or even framed.
Son of a bitch.
As long as there is something to eat that is lovelier.
No one is easy. Live is like a show, you have to look at the script to know what to perform.
Somebody's got to be somebody.
The top scorers in all 360 walks of life are the Imperial examiners. So much effort and endeavor behind the top scorers in the Imperial exam. This humiliates the word "beaver".
Haha.
Overdo.
Reality.
shoot those hooligans.
Cheap performer.
Cheap performer.
The entertainment circles are dirty. All the men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
It's not easy to be a star female. They're pained, but who to blame?
Everybody does this. If you don't, how can you make money?
The woman is proud in front of others, but when she is left alone she is in a melancholy mood.
To put it simply, nowadays's stars are just the popular ancient time prostitutes. Now they are famous famous famous famous prostitutes, so it is just normal for them to drink or even sleep with some high officials.
Stop talking to other people, just be a "behaver".
What should we do in the future? The ability alone is not enough to succeed. Should we face such a hard choice too?
More suffering disguised as a glorious look is indisputable.
It's not so bad because they're just playing in their own circles out of sight and out of mind.
But there is an old guy in his circle, Zhang Jizhong, who behaves like a hooligan, and also thinks that he is virtuous, making TV series when he has nothing to do, wrecking the whole country.
Both took what they needed.
How can China have pure innocent girls?
The story is now very shocking in the entertainment world. There are rumors that Hsu Yuki was forced out for refusing to drink with a guest arranged by the company and had to switch to working as a lawyer's assistant instead to make ends meet.
Super stars often encounter social engagement or circumstances that they do not welcome but have to join in.
After all, they can't decide on many things because it has to do with many aspects and many people's interests.
Sometimes it's not that simple to be a star in a very normal dinner party that seems ordinary to us ordinary people, like we imagine.
Star people have a lot of contracts and if they tackle well the money will roll in. Force out or even a frame will come to her heels if she doesn't tack well.
The two kinds of star-female are those who always hold very high integrity and sternly reject all such invitations.
The second kind of person is good at playing tricks and achieving his objective with his seed money.
Rumour is that even the super star female is going to win her first role this way.
After drinking some alcohol, the advertiser or sponsor could have a chance to lie on the star female's shoulder, feel her chin, or kiss her cheek, and the star female would most adopt an enduring attitude.
They are the very people in the lower 9 professions.
Those stars are just pretending and actually living much better lives than this.
Agreed that they are just cheap entertainers. However, their reputation in feudal China makes somewhat sense.
Agreed.
Oh well, actors aren't easy.
They deserve it. They asked for that.
It's dawning on me that nothing is easy.
Women are birds and beasts and men are worse than birds and beasts.

braawwkkk.
It doesn't take long.
In late 2004, Route 288, which runs around the southwest quadrant of the Richmond New Urban Region, was opened.
It has already changed the development patterns, making them worse, and caused localised traffic congestion around its exit.
Today the Richmond Times-Dispatch told the tale of the impact of the Huguenot Trail in Powhatan County.
Will Jones reported that traffic in one section of the Huguenot Trail has more than doubled since the 288 opened.
Speed and accidents have surged as well.
So far this year, 17 accidents have been reported near the Winterfield Road intersection, up from all of 2004's 12.
Virginia Department of Transportation engineer Dale Totten noted that if the state had more money it would have four lanes of road at a cost of about $13 million.
Of course, the VDOT doesn't have the money to construct roads in the Richmond region.
Because the VDOT spent all their frigging money on the 288 because of local politicians and boosters.
Where is Homer Simpson when you need him?
This is a major moment, doh.
As we predicted, Route 288 generated residential development in all but the sparsely populated areas around its exit, overtaxing local country roads.
Other people choose where to work and where to live, but limited access highways can relieve traffic for people driving back and forth between Chesterfield and Goochland Counties.
And they create traffic congestion in new places.
Only this rapidity surprised me.
Even I think there may be a lag of three or four years.
Think of the liability that Route 288 has already created for all of its exits because it has already created road construction at a cost of $13 million at just one of these exits.
Another prediction.
The need for new road improvements will soar in the next few years after the scatter development of subdivisions and approval of a mega commercial project at the intersection of 288 and major roads.
Well, we can see that by the end of the decade, the unfunded liability will well be zooming past the original 4.5 billion dollars it took to build the original highway.
You are a brainiac who thinks Route 288 is such a great idea.
Thank you for nothing.
I think we could have spent that $4B elsewhere for better.
I don't think you should be blaming 288 for the creation of those people.
If they were enough to create a new congestion of traffic in a new place, what would be the alternative?
Is traffic congested in the old place additionally?
Now you understand how people like TMT in Fairfax feel.
I usually take a pro-road position.
However, with the glaring need in other parts of the state, 288 is definitely an overabundance.
Richmond has virtually no traffic.
The rush hour lasted 30 minutes.
And you give them a large rural area beltway.
Road to nowhere.
Just think how much of this money could be spent on another Potomac crossing facility or road improvements desperately needed in NOVA.
Virginia Centrists: The reason the rest of the state helped pay for the 288 in the budget deal last year is because it wiped out the debt, adding insult to injury.
Very nice of you all to have to.
However, it doesn't make much sense.
Same old problem.
If you get ahead of the need, you'll be accused of sprawl.
If you build in a place where the need is already acute, you cannot pave your way out of congestion, it is claimed.
Anonymous
That's a fair point.
5:26 makes a good point.
However, this situation hammers home the validity of the state auditors'report, which found that the CTB and DOT are funding transportation projects based on the best lobbyists, rather than comprehensive plans for state transportation.
I submit that this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated.
And Senator Chichester and his toadies are pouring more money into this flawed institution, making this worse.
What is the point of transportation expenses?
In Virginia, it was for the benefit of private business plans, not for serving the public interest.
You're dead wrong.
No less than Walter Stoch stated that the intention was to pay for the development of the economy with money from the construction of the 288.
Come on folks.
TMT, I don't understand your point.
When was the last time you were stuck in traffic, not in some sort of business, but in traffic.
It seems to me that the whole point of the road is to facilitate the public interest in getting into and getting out of private business.
Of course, the drive on Sunday, the trip to the grandmother's location, and the soccer game were all overwhelming needs for business support.
No wonder we suffer congestion problems, our road expenditures do not match business or state GDP increases.
If we recognize that the primary benefit of the road is to the business, then we should do two things.
Of course businesses will pay for more of our transportation bills and we will incentivize them to locate where it is least stressful to the system even if it means more overall travel.
Why is it so hard to understand?
The solution is a functioning human settlement pattern and a balance between the capacity of the transport system and the demand for travel generated by land use.
All else is spin.
EMR
TMT: In Virginia, it was for the benefit of private business plans, not for serving the public interest.
I don't see the point in this statement because it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else.
I think they are tightly intertwined so they are virtually the same.
The lumpiness of this cookie dough is obvious local problem.
However, if we demonize businesses long enough, we will eventually find ourselves all working for the devil in aggregate.
I don't see the point in claiming that balance is the solution to an ever-changing dynamic nature.
Even you see the positives in the rail to dulles because it is a job center that promotes a bidirectional demand for rail.
I agree.
In fact, that may be all the reason it was built on all on it's own.
All I'm saying is that the exact same logic should apply to the road.
They should have destinations at both ends so that we use our investments to maximum.
We need more places to get closer to the balance you say we need.
Reality checks here.
I drive past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
I commute back and forth to work via huguenot trail.
I've never seen anything remotely like a flood of traffic.
It's a 55 mph zone with cars averaging 75-100 in the morning.
The road is already planned to be widened because of heavy demand for development on the Chesterfield side, new schools, and a whole bunch of existing development zones that funneled through Robious Road years ago.
Instead of bottlenecks in Powhatan and Chesterfield due to lack of roads, the roads are wonderful to those of us who actually use them.
We can do commercial development and work closer to where we live.
You might think that's an irrational use of land.
I have no desire to live in any city.
I refuse to work in the downtown area.
I refuse to use mass transit, as it is unsafe for female commuters who work long, irregular hours.
And I happen to like the development of a large lot.
I don't understand exactly how I'm supposed to keep horses in a half acre lot.
One gallon of gas can go for $10.
And I still pay to live in the country.
Many people legitimately prefer horses, hunting, gardens and certain types of small businesses, which makes them not want to live in urban cores.
This city living infatuation is truly baffling.
Anonymous 6:37: Every person has every right to live in a country if they wish to.
But you have no right to have the rest of the state underwrite the construction of a 4 billion dollar highway to make shopping and getting to work easier.
In the debate over the 288, everything else that could be spent has been consistently overlooked.
If the money is applied to other road projects, such as press projects, or even (god forbid) no road projects, it could alleviate much congestion in traffic.
Ray Hyde, my comments are directed at the investors who lobby for roads to be placed near property owners and the incompetent system that funds these requests regardless of whether they are linked or not to the master transportation plan.
I'm 24 and a mother of 2.
I've been broken up with my son's father since August.
I wanted to start dating other people and my son's father said it would have nothing to do with him.
He is very possessive and controlling, but he has no right to be because we are together.
There is too much going on in his life right now and he thinks we can work even though I have told him several times I don't love him and he doesn't love me.
I want him there for his son too, he doesn't need me.
But he has no one. His family doesn't get along with him and they have their issues.
I don't want to be miserable anymore and would be more miserable if he was around longer.
I don't want him there for his son because he's a good father or at least tried to be.
I believe that every child needs both parents whether they are together or not.
But he thinks no one can have me if he can't have me.
What am I going to do to move on with my life?
It's very bad when your ex threatens you using your son.
You have to not give in to that, it will just escalate if you do.
You have a right to live your life and be happy so don't cave to his threats.
If he really loved his son, he would have seen him no matter what, but this is just a typical control method his people use.
Other people have said things like "If you leave me, I'll kill myself." Does it get through to you?
DATE.
meet all kinds of people.
Do what you want.
You would probably be better off without him if he had voluntarily walked out of your both lives.
I agree, one other thing, he doesn't have time for you to date or not.
I didn't tell him.
Not because he's a threat, but because he's not concerned about your personal life.
Can you document his threats?
You really need.
quit taking his calls and make him leave voice mails.
Make sure he e-mails or texts you.
Keep that record.
Get a lawyer and get a divorce.
Try legal aid if you can't afford one.
Tell your ex that all communication needs to go through a lawyer.
The bus driver, the till person and the delivery person for your food all want exactly the same change.
Do they not realize that you don't get a pile of change from the bank?
Will someone have to take a note somewhere?
People get lazy.
I like to be as near to the copper as I can because I don't like counting it all day.
If you take a £20 note on the bus they will just tell you to get off the bus because they are lazy as hell.
It is illegal to pay a certain amount with a load of coins, you can only pay something like £30 with a load of coins.
Hello, I'm starting uni in September but obviously I'm not immediately gelling to it like most people are.
I know it will take me some time to adjust though, I'm always a very introvert and shy person, especially anxious and all the rest.
All my housemates and I went out the first night I was here and it was the hardest thing I ever had to do.
I went by myself to the student union bar when I was sober.
Fact here, but more to the point.
After being here for about 5 months, I'm not enjoying University. I'm disillusioned with the course, don't enjoy the set projects and don't like the delivery of the course much.
The university has been made out to be much better than it seems.
I started the first term in bad shape. Student finances were delayed adding to my stress level and I was so worried that I was unable to progress in my work due to all the piles, concluded.
I was assigned a counsellor at uni and saw her for about 5-6 weeks in a block session and it really didn't work out because I never opened up to her to be honest.
Only half hearted.
I'm now loaded with work on my neck, I have to hit a major deadline, I'm depressed and the anxiety is resulting in me feeling miserable all the time.
I no longer have counselling as you can only have so many sessions at a time and I doubt it will help me much this time if it hasn't already.
I lack motivation, I don't feel comfortable with my lecturers, I feel like I want to give in, but I can't bring myself to give in because I would end up in a dead end job and aspire to be someone.
I would rather die than not get an education and not live the life I want to live, and the matter would be made worse by dropping out of uni.
I'm 21, turning 22 this year, and I don't have much time left to fail, so I have to do something.
I don't want to go through the system over and over and consistently fail. I failed college once and did another course so I could get to uni.
Please can someone give me some advice?
Go and see your GP and see if there is any way you can get your deadline extended to try and ease the pressure a bit.
Send your tutor an email like this and they will consider mitigating circumstances. Don't worry, they have seen all of the "much more uncomfortable" admissions before. I know because I used to work in the University administration department.
Break up your work into a chunk you can manage.
Concentrate on one bit of work at a time, obviously the most urgent assignment.
Don't shut off your housemates, and do well at trying new things from the very beginning. Now keep it up.
I recommend you go see your doctor too.
If you are always an anxious person you may benefit from speaking to someone. My friend gets therapy from the NHS so it's really normal.
I'm sure your university would allow it if you were being honest, try and get an extension on the deadline.
Keep strong and keep carrying on.
My Mum divorced. She had a horrible time with my stepfather and the new freedom she found sent her round the bend.
She has epilepsy, manic depression and a huge anger problem.
She is constantly horrible to me.
When I was at home I could not cope with her outbursts and nasty remarks.
At my breaking point I was an 18 year old with 95% bursaries, full time student in a high pressure private school in sixth form.
I can't work at home because she shouts at me.
Then I got angry at my teachers.
She was lovely for one minute, like having my mummy back, and then turned into the most spiteful human alive the next minute.
I have not passed my A2 exam and I have already accepted defeat and that this year of my life will make me fail.
How can I possibly come back from this? The University offered me the most amazing thing but I couldn't even accept it. I've never made a grade.
I wish I could wipe her out of my life. Without her things would be so much better.
But then I thought I was just being selfish.
But that doesn't mean my life is like this, does it?
It should be so much better.
But I feel like I have no control over this downward spiral.
And I don't know what to do.
Thanks for reading.
Nice vent.
You can't get a section on her because of that.
Does she even have a history of mental illness or diagnosis?
You sure don't know you won't get a good grade, so accept the place if you can.
Life throws things at you all the time.
If not someone from your family, then an outsider.
I had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad long before I came to uni and honestly the only reason I'm here is because it's the only way out.
If you really want out, work hard.
It really sounds like you need support from somewhere else if she can't give it to you consistently.
Can you call childline or something like that?
You can go to the library on a Saturday and study for a good 8 hours.
Can you go to a friend's house to form a study group?
You want her section because it's a bit of a pain in the arse and you blame it for all your problems?
I know how you feel.
My mum was spit out of hell too.
I highly recommend taking up smoking.
Oh, tsr grew up and stopped being a nag. It's a joke.
I think I've become a much weaker person in the last year and a half, and in the way of trying to make friends with some people at uni, I've dulled my personality down.
But being nice to people over leads them to believe they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me.
They showed absolutely no respect.
For example, I said hello to someone from uni and they ignored me but then 30 minutes later they decided they wanted me to help them with some work and I gave them help.
It caused a lot of anger and distress in its life and it really started affecting my concentration at university.
Has anyone got any experience with handling this sort of thing or how it goes to gain some respect again?
You just said no.
If you're not particularly comfortable with it, gradually do it.
You can start with "I'm sorry, but I'm busy."
Of course you don't go over the top with it, you don't go completely the opposite direction.
If you think no in your mind, then say no.
Once they start to realize you won't bend over backwards for them, they'll start to respect you more.
Well, this is really a bad attitude. If you're nice, but just letting them do anything to you, then of course you can be respected. That's not nice, but that's the fool.
I don't know if anyone has read this but I'm just feeling desperate and feel the need to tell someone.
I left home in September and started Uni. I was incredibly anxious to do this but delayed thinking about it until I got here. I'm here now and have been for over 2 weeks. I'm feeling terribly overwhelmed by it all and socially awkward.
Since moving into secondary school I have struggled emotionally for the majority of my life. I lost my dad when I was around 9 and have always blamed it on how I felt. I had two counselling periods in my life in December 2009 and March of this year, roughly 15 months.
I feel at the moment that my life's problems are so overwhelmingly overwhelming that I am making myself ever more doubtful of my self esteem, which has always been low. I am unable to concentrate on work, I often find myself becoming very quiet on social occasions, and I doubt myself about anything and everything.
My two counsellors have not diagnosed me with depression and have suggested I don't suffer from it, but it's a huge worry for me as depression is what caused my dad to die and caused my mum to commit suicide.
I've tried to solve my problem before, I find exercise and meditation to be particularly useful, I've also tried things like self help books and tapes, but I generally feel this is how I'm living, I'm wasting one chance to exist and one chance to be a young man. This feeling is beating me away.
I simply don't know what to do and when I think of what to do, I never follow through. My friends often say I'm lazy and I can't disagree with them a lot of times. I feel like people are trying to do everything they can to help and I fail again and again.
Sorry for anyone reading this jumbled mess, I'm feeling a bit like a self-seeking moaner but I truly do feel desperate.
It is common for the feelings people have for themselves to become more intense when they are in a new situation and feel the pressure to socialize with strangers and fit into the new role of university student.
I am not a health professional and can only speak from personal experience, so I strongly suggest that you see a qualified health professional about how you feel and worry about depression.
Most people feel awkward and un-intelligent when they first get to uni, so you're definitely not alone there, but I really recommend getting an appointment with your university counselling service, it really doesn't matter if anyone tells you you're depressed or not, you obviously have some problems at the minute and could use some support, labels are not as important as your experience, meditation and exercise are really helpful so try to do both, but you have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere, don't beat yourself up because you feel you're not motivated to do anything at the minute, a lot of people feel like this and hopefully this will pass when you begin to feel better, but be kind to yourself, it only makes you feel worse.
Good luck.
I think a lot of people feel the same way you do, but medicate themselves by using friends. Probably not the solution as such, but definitely better to be around friends when you are depressed than alone and depressed. Either way, feel free to message me private message if you fancy chatting.
If you were my idol, I would focus on someone who came from a bad background and ended up being successful, happy, having a family, getting married, etc. You don't want them, but you aspire to someone who you admire and respect.
You focus on what you have achieved in life, you do not state what you are studying or indeed why you are studying, because you want to experience? Because your mum wants you to go? Because you need a degree for a career you want?
Either way, sum up why you're there and work your bottom off to get the best grades possible, because when you get your degree, you'll have something to say like "Hey, I didn't fail, I worked hard and passed.
X
I hope this helps.
I'm pretty much not Autistic (although I think the doctor misdiagnosed me as dyspraxia) but I do walk on my toes nearly all the time.
It's more comfortable for me.
What makes them decide that walking on toes is a sign of autism because it seems so random and doesn't always indicate.
Well, I might have a sign of something on the autism spectrum, but who doesn't have one or two?
You guys know what I mean.
Walking on toes can be a symptom of autism.
The headache could be a symptom of a brain tumor.
Feeling tired is a symptom of leukaemia.
Not that symptoms always apply, but in a lot of cases they clearly do, such as in this instance, so it is worth noting if nothing is ever diagnosed without a note.
I walk on my toes, but that's because I was born with a strange curled under toe that had to be straightened out by surgery two years ago.
My brother is autistic but I don't notice it either, the spectrum is so broad and I probably have mild Asperger's which causes communication problems and I don't pick up on social reactions/body language.
But then I have no proper diagnosis and even if you have some symptoms, that doesn't mean you have a certain condition.
I don't walk on my toes much because I've been told I don't for years.
I have dyspraxia.
So maybe you are dyspraxic or have short-tendons.
It's being drilled by people who do dance/gymnastics/ballet etc, and I'm finding it more comfortable now.
I don't read too much about random symptoms like that.
Hello, I'm a 12 year old girl who will be 13 in 2 days. I'm an addict to self harm.
From that day on, I started to slit each individual finger with a scissors, and never stopped.
It's getting worse because I have a scar on my leg from being slit with a staple in the name of my ex because I wouldn't stop cutting if I bled.
I have several slit in my arms.
They will be healed and then I will cut myself with the school robbery staples and a razor.
I take around 5 paracetamol and other drugs and take them with lager and vodka when the cut isn't to be found.
I was really tempted to cut my arms off or burn myself as I wrote this.
I am an addict. When one is healed I will cut again.
I think about it daily.
I'm 12 and my life is already sick.
This is a source of my dad leaving when I was 7 and he didn't want to know me anymore.
He just cares about his new little girl, his wife and his new life, which I don't want.
My best mate died when I was 10.
I was in a relationship with a 16 year old boy and he was forbidden from speaking to me because of what happened and the age difference.
My mum also suffers from Bipolar and I have depression.
I don't want to stop.
I don't care what I do, I just want to do it again and again to torture myself. I hate myself.
But I do love my best mate loads and he means the world to me and if he will do anything, I will do anything.
I didn't tell him but he found out.
I don't want to hurt him. I don't want him to hurt himself.
What do I do?
Thanks for reading.
Are you on any drugs or do you get any therapy?
You should talk to your school nurse or GP and tell them what's going on.
School teachers can be people you trust and can tell.
People can help you if you tell them.
If you keep it bottled up inside, it will only get worse.
Trust me, this is better to get this thing over with asap rather than letting it get even worse.
Please do not do this.
I'm 17 and started self harm last year (mainly cutting my arms) but stopped it a few months ago.
It's hard, but you can do it.
I feel so much happier, but seeing the scar reminds me of how I felt at that time and how strong that feeling was that I wanted to do such a thing to myself.
Also, strong and you can do it. It found salvation through poetry writing and keeping a journal.
Self harm is addictive, but you can overcome it.
Remember self harm does not define who you are.
You can overcome it.
In the past year I have found myself always checking my own belongings to make sure I haven't lost or left anything every time I go out, especially to university, so I think I've got a form of OCD.
I often have to check twice a go and then after 30 seconds can't resist checking again for some reason.
Why is this?
Am I crazy or something?
It most often happens when I am carrying many things but rarely when I am not, and even then I still check daily. Is this an OCD disease to any extent?
What can I do about this?
I often get very anxious, but it sort of goes away after 15-30 minutes if I don't check, but there is so much anxiety that I can't wait that long.
I feel doomed if I lose my wallet or my phone, or I do.
I just wish I could go out every 2 minutes without worrying about leaving something or losing it.
I don't really know what to do and am afraid to go to a GP.
They probably never heard of some compulsion like this and I just don't know what to do.
Do any of you have a similar ritual?
People think I'm crazy, but it's very difficult to get out of this.
What can you advise me?
I use to do this on the way to college. I had a list of items I knew I had and I used to compulsive check on the bus.
I know it's easier said than done, I now have more severe anxiety and I think this is a warning sign, so just try and wean yourself off the habit when it's relatively fresh and definitely visit your GP, but also don't keep telling yourself not to check on these things.
Don't worry about that, the doctor saw a much worse case.
In my psychology class today I did an "OCD" emoticon.
The only way you can get rid of it is just avoid compulsive acts, so don't check if you've lost something and just leave it at that.
Although your anxiety level increases over the duration, it gradually decreases, hopefully this will cause your OCD to disappear overtime.
That just sounds to me like you're over anxious rather than having a really bad OCD.
I am very obsessed with getting up every 20 minutes to check all the locks in my house in particular.
Sometimes I am convinced they are not locked, even though I know they are.
I think once the obsession really starts interrupting your daily routine, it will become a real problem.
Don't worry, I'm sure your GP understands the issue, you're definitely not crazy.
I went to therapy for other reasons also and they encouraged me to pick a number that was obviously less than 20 (I checked) and stick with it and cut down.
I think teaching is a good idea and if I get 5 or 20 checks I'm still okay.
So far I'm a lot better and I think there's definitely hope for anyone who wants to improve.
I'm usually pretty calm about things, I like to take things as they come and don't worry too much.
However, in the past month or so, I've found myself really anxious about things, and I'm not talking about merely feeling nervous out of the blue.
I'm beginning to feel irrational panic over a variety of things that I didn't worry too much about beforehand and didn't even cross my mind as something that would cause a bell to ring in my head.
I'm not sure if this is because of a lifestyle change (eg going from a student free care person to an unemployed graduate) or if it's a sign of other issues, but it's beginning to bug me because it affects my confidence and happiness.
I've spoken to a few of my parents about it, but at the same time, all of them think I'm going through a random phase and I should hold off on acting until it's clear there's a serious problem.
What is the best thing to do, so wonder.
Speak to the doctor and see if the anti anxiety pill can take the edge off things?
I see I can speak to a counsellor?
Or should I take the advice of those around me and just keep an eye on anxiety until it becomes a problem?
Well, I shouldn't start trying to keep an eye on your anxiety, because that would make me tense and more likely to panic. There's a death circle in there.
As soon as you start feeling a bit panicky about anything, I recommend you try focusing on something that will guarantee you will smile or feel happier.
Or get one of your friends to make you laugh when you start to feel panic. If you can't do that, then it works for me and I suffer random panic attacks lol.
I'm just starting to really worry about tiny things, even though it's not as severe as it sounds.
I find just talking to someone else about what makes you anxious helps.
Perhaps in a way that makes me feel better, I find myself mentioning my worries to my mum and seeing her react to the situation as I should, so I know it's not a big deal and I don't need to be anxious about it.
But if it gets worse, go to the doctor.
I have friends who suffer from severe anxiety that may prevent them from leaving the house and doing things because they are so worried about what might go wrong.
The doctor gave her medication and it made her much better.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has reached an agreement with Iranian officials stating that there are no remaining issues and no remaining ambiguities regarding Iran's nuclear program and activities.
U.S. and European officials suspect Iran's civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce an atomic bomb.
U.S. and European officials suspect Iran's civilian nuclear energy program is a mask for efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce an atomic bomb.
U.S. and European officials could impose a 4th round of sanctions on Tehran when the U.N. Security Council considers the Iranian nuclear program most likely in September 2007.
The International Atomic Energy Agency distributed a limited copy of the IAEA report before the 35 members of the IAEA board met on September 11, 2007.
The finding reflects the Agency's agreement with Tehran on August 21, 2007, which was publicized by Iranian officials beginning the week of August 12, 2007.
The accord said the Iranian nuclear program and Iran's nuclear activities remain unresolved and without ambiguity.
Reuters news agency said the IAEA report said it was a significant step forward in the work plan.
Reuters quoted a senior U.N. official as stating that the Iranian government's efforts to enrich uranium are slow.
The IAEA report stated that Iranian officials must continue to build confidence in the scope and nature of Iran's present and future nuclear program.
A Iranian official stated on August 30, 2007 that Iranian officials are cooperating with the IAEA so that further rounds of international sanctions can be prevented.
Iran's representative to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to the Fars news agency in Tehran that the report emphasized that no signs or evidence exists indicating that Iran's nuclear activities have been diverted and that all Iranian nuclear materials are being audited.
Some non-proliferation experts have stated that the IAEA has conceded too much to Iran.
In a criticism published the week of 19 August 2007 Washington-based arms control expert David Albright and Washington-based arms control expert Jacqueline Shire wrote that the idea of closing files violated fundamental principles and that the agreement did not specify that key people needed to verify the IAEA's answer to questions would be provided access to the IAEA.
Experts state that Iran's latest agreement with the IAEA to allow inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information is short of Western demands that Iran halt production of concentrated uranium which could potentially be used in a bomb.
U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that Iranian officials have not met any international obligations with regard to the nuclear program but that the report may offer some new details or insight into Iran's program development.
Casey stated that the Iranian regime's continued defiance of the international community shows that the nuclear program is moving forward.
Most non-proliferation experts in the West stated that the August 21 agreement contained little that could dissuade policy makers in Washington, London, Paris and Berlin from moving forward with another round of Security Council sanctions.
Experts stated that many of the transparency issues that were reported to have been resolved in the agreement on August 21, 2007 should have been resolved previously.
Executive Director of the non-partisan Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl G. Kimball stated that the agreement addresses the problem of the Iranian government's pursuit of enrichment technology and capabilities that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material.
Kimball stated that the Iranian government is designing to deflect criticism and pressure and claim progress.
Iranian officials stated that cooperation with inspectors could be reduced with more sanctions.
The Security Council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on Iran despite U.S. demands due to pressure from China and Russia.
In an interview on state-controlled Iranian television SOLTANIEH stated that the reports and measures made no justification for any other international organization including the Security Council to intervene in an irrelevant way.

A document outlining Israel's proposal to allow the transfer of nuclear technology to non-proliferation-signing States was distributed to the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win India's exemption from engagement in nuclear trade.
Israeli officials convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the transfer of nuclear technology to non-proliferation-signing States.
India, Israel and Pakistan are among countries that have not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade including the purchase of reactors, uranium fuel or yellowcake.
A document outlining Israel's proposal was distributed to the 45 members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group in March 2007.
The Israeli presentation was made without official papers allowing for official denials.
A letter from the chairman of the NSG said on March 17, 2007 that the Israeli presentation was offered in the context of the organization's debate over Indian officials' bid for an exemption.
India and Israel are the only two nations that have not signed the treaty and India's proposal would qualify it for admission to the NSG.
The Israeli plan offers 12 criteria for allowing trade with non-treaty nuclear States.
One criterion indicates Israel's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and says that States should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if they apply stringent physical protection, controls and accounting measures to all weapons and facilities on Israeli territory, as well as sources and special nuclear materials on Israeli territory.
The document was circulated on Capitol Hill in September 2007 as the Bush administration worked toward an agreement with Indian officials.
Executive Director of the Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl Kimball stated that the Israeli documents could affect the debate over India.
Kimball stated --
The dynamic at the NSG is that the country's officials do not want to be an obstacle to India and the United States, the two most powerful countries.
It will be difficult to reach a consensus with India at the NGS meeting in November 2007.
The Israeli proposal gives officials from some countries reason to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
Israel's record is good and better than India's following international nuclear rules.
The Bush administration rejected the Israeli proposal despite the Israeli government's ties to the U.S. government.
The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win India's exemption from engagement in nuclear trade.
President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice view the pact as an important part of Bush's legacy of foreign policy.
The deal is controversial in India and must be given approval by Congress.
Delays in winning approval for the Indian deal could have a negative effect on the administration's foreign policy legacy with election years being the most affected.
State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that the U.S. government views the Indian deal as unique and does not see it as precedent for any other country including Israel.
Israeli embassy spokesman David Siegel stated that it is grossly inaccurate to suggest that the Israeli government has demanded or is linking the effort to any other issue including the Indian debate.
Seigel stated --
The Israeli government has never asked or made any specific requests to the NSG for exemption from the nuclear supply guidelines.
Israel is recognized as a full fledged adherent to the NSSG guidelines.
The Israeli government urged the NSG to consider adopting a generic approach to nuclear technology transfer based on criteria of multiple tiers.
Some NGS officials have previously suggested an approach similar to the Israeli plan.
A nuclear non-proliferation regime would be considerably enhanced if the NSSG guidelines were modified along the lines proposed by Israeli officials.

Ahmadinejad announced Iran's capacity to produce uranium would be expanded.
Iran has refused to commit to a halt to the expansion but has hinted that there may be a future halt.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of Mashbad on 26 July 2008 that Iran will expand its arsenal of 5,000 centrifuges that produce enriched uranium.
Ahmadinejad's assertion was the first since the announcement in April 2008 that Iran was approaching to implement 6000 centrifuges.
Iran has articulated a goal of 50000 centrifuges operating at an enrichment plant near Natanz.
The international community demands that Iran halt production of nuclear materials.
Media reports differ from the number of centrifuges cited by Ahmadinejad.
Iranian news agencies reported that Ahmadinejad stated that Iran had 6000 working centrifuges but subsequently removed the statement from the Internet.
Another Iranian news agency stated that Ahmadinejad referred to 100000 centrifuges.
Experts discount the significance of Ahmadinejad's claims because of the absence of information on the functionality of the centrifuge.
A Western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity in Tehran stated that the number of centrifuges was less important than the operation and efficiency of the machines but that Ahmadinejad's assertion would hinder resolution of the diplomatic standoff between Iran and the West.
New America Foundation arms control expert Jeffrey G. Lewis stated that the New America Foundation is aware of Iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but that the status of the machines is unknown.
Diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems hinder Iran's enrichment program.
Iran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program is aimed only at producing electricity because nuclear weapons production is contrary to Islamic principles.
The US, Israel, Europe and the majority of Western arms control experts believe Iran is pursuing the ability to produce a bomb immediately upon a decision.
Experts state that producing weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material is relatively simple.
Ahmadinejad stated that the West is still pursuing negotiations after Iran resisted Western demands to halt its nuclear activities.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana recently presented two offers to Iran.
The package is a US-endorsed incentive to cease production of enriched uranium.
During the pre-negotiations Iran did not add centrifuges and the West refrained from promoting a 4th round of economic sanctions against Iran at the UN Security Council for a 6 week freeze for freeze period.
US officials have repeatedly stated that negotiations cannot begin before Iran halts all enrichment-related activities that can be verified but the Bush administration recently agreed to a proposed freeze and dispatched Burns to Geneva.
On 26 July 2008 Iran refused to respond to Solana's offer at talks in Geneva attended by US undersecretary of state for State William J. Burns.
The talks constitute the highest level of diplomatic contacts between the US and Iran in nearly 30 years.
Solana and Burns, along with European envoys, set a deadline for Iran to respond positively before initiating new sanctions including a ban on the sale of refined petroleum products vital to Iran's economy.
Iranian officials refuse to commit to stopping the expansion or observing the deadline.
On 26 July 2008 it appeared that Ahmadinejad was suggesting that Iran could potentially halt the expansion with a higher number of centrifuges than previously expected for over 6 weeks.
Ahmadinejad stated that if the number of operational centrifuges were not increased the West would consent to the 5,000-6000 existing ones.
If highly enriched, the 5,000 centrifuges could produce enough nuclear material for a power plant or an atomic bomb.
6000 continuously-running centrifuges can produce enough weapons-grade uranium for 1 bomb in 6 months.
The International Atomic Energy Agency stated in May 2008 that Iran possesses 3500 operational centrifuges.

Diplomatic meetings in Paris concluded with no agreement on further steps to pressure Iran to halt uranium enrichment at its Natanz facility.
Diplomats stated to the media on November 14, 2008 that officials from the United States, Europe, Russia and China have not reached any further agreement to act to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment at its Natanz facility.
High-tech uranium enrichment is a process that can produce fuel for nuclear power plants and can produce fissile material for atomic weapons.
The meeting on November 13, 2008 ended with no new measures announced.
The French Foreign Ministry released a statement after the meeting on 13 November 2008 declaring that the international community reaffirmed the importance of a dual-track approach to diplomatic engagement and work towards sanctions against Iran.
Russia and China are resisting new sanctions on Iran.
Russia and China have close political and business ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran and do not feel domestic pressure to act against Iran.
The United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran have no close political and business ties and the United States feels domestic pressure to act against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Russia and China hold veto power over Security Council decisions.
The Interfax news agency in Moscow quoted Russian diplomat Sergei Ryabkov as stating that the party did not strike a deal with Iran at the meeting on November 13, 2008 and that Western countries are in favor of the sanctions but China and Iran are not.
Sergei Ryabkov attended the meeting on November 13, 2008.
A report released this week reports that Iran has made significant progress on the construction of a research reactor facility near Arak.
Iran's heavy water research reactor near Arak could eventually produce plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons.
A satellite image published by the Institute for Science and International Security shows significant progress in construction of a heavy-water research reactor facility near Arak from February 2008 to October 2008.
David Albright stated that Iran's heavy-water research reactor near Arak evaded international security community notice.
David Albright stated that satellite images say that Iran's heavy-water research reactor near Arak is making significant progress and has progressed from a building frame to a large finished facility in the past 1.5 years.
David Albright is a former arms inspector and the director of the Institute for Science and International Security based in Washington D.C.
Iran has stated that it will pursue nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research.
The United States and its Western allies suspect that Iran's efforts to produce were preceded by Iran's creation of a nuclear weapons infrastructure.
Low grade uranium production is legal under international arms control regulations.
Iran's latest nuclear technology developments show the complex technical and diplomatic challenges facing the incoming United States foreign policy team under President-elect Barack Obama in taking on the task of stopping Iran from mastering technology that could be used in the manufacture and delivery of nuclear weapons.
Last month in power, the George W. Bush administration managed to synchronize its policy with the leaders of the European Union, Britain, France and Germany to press for tougher sanctions on Iran and diplomatic action.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is expected to release a report critical of Iran next week.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is a United Nations nuclear watchdog.
A new initiative on Iran's nuclear program has not emerged and talks are scheduled to take place in Paris on November 13, 2008, so hopes of imposing another set of United Nations Security Council sanctions before the end of President Bush's term have decreased.
Iran continues to work toward mastering nuclear and missile technology through diplomatic maneuvering.
Some Israeli officials have stated that they are alarmed by Iran's test firing of a 2-stage solid fuel rocket with a range of 1200 miles this week.
Tel Aviv is less than 650 miles from Iranian territory.

Russian high-security laboratory complex that stores anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria faces loss of electricity due to lack of payment to electricity utility Mosenergo.
A large repository of deadly anthrax, plague and other bacteria stored in a high-security Russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of Moscow threatens to lose electricity.
Russian laboratory complex officials recently arrived at the Moscow region's electricity utility Mosenergo and threatened to turn off electricity due to lack of payment.
The Russian laboratory complex is a 90-building campus and served as a location for a secret biological weapons program during the Soviet era.
An incorrect headline in the Izvestia newspaper stated that the deadly virus from the Moscow regional depository is a threat to Moscow.
No virus was located at the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
At the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology there are bacteria of every kind that have been killed to study their use in the Soviet Union's secret biological weapons program.
A large virus repository is located in Siberia.
Russian and Western officials stated that power cuts at the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology are unlikely to result in any threat to public health.
Russian and western officials stated that there was not enough certainty to know whether the loss of power at the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology was a threat to public health.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology has a quite reliable and self-protection system.
General Nikolai N. Urakov is the longtime director of the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology.
The State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is working with Western scientists to convert the complex into a biomedicine manufacturing site.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that scientists at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology were scared by this sudden threat of a power shut-down because of the kind of psychological pressure they were under.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that if the power is shut down at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology, scientists must destroy all the biological experiments that have been in the way.
General Nikolai N. Urakov would like the United States and Western countries, who have contributed about 6 million US dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapons complex, to contribute another 500,000 US dollars per year to pay the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology's electric bills and arrears.
An American scientist who works closely with the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology stated that it is the Russian government's responsibility to pay the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology's electric bills.
Western aid in converting General Nikolai N. Urakov's bioweapons laboratory peaked in 1997 when it was learned that Iran had offered to purchase the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology's experts.
It is known that Russian scientists and military leaders who now depend on western finance to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have orchestrated the crisis to increase financial.
American scientist Randall Lee beatty is working to convert the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
Beatty stated that this threat of electricity cuts at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is a crisis.
Randall Lee beatty is the International Science and Technology Center's director.
The International Science and Technology Center is financed by General Nikolai N. Urakov with approximately half of the budget to support about 350 Russian biowarfare scientists and technicians.
Randall Lee beatty stated that it is known that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology has not paid its electricity bill for 14 months.
Randall Lee beatty stated that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is one of the world's most important archives of dangerous pathogen and it would be a shame to destroy it because of non-payment of electricity utilities.
Approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology and many of them are stored in cryogenic caskes cooled by liquid nitrogen isolated from the environment in layers of enclosures and in oversize air handling systems that all depend on electricity to function.
Defrosting living germ currently in a frozen state is the greatest danger from the shut-down of electric power at the State Scientific and applied Microbiology Center.
Biological warfare expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies Raymond Zilinskas stated that the main threat to the organism is not escape, but rather the cutting of power to the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
Raymond Zilinskas stated that in the worst case the bacteria will be defrosted and the cleanup will be a real mess because it is certainly not known whether all the bacteria will die.
Another example is the confrontation between the electricity utility Mosenergo and the State Scientific Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk, in which the basic capitalist imperative of sustaining enterprises may come into conflict with the old Soviet weapons science, which remains from the Soviet era.
An overdue power bill in 2000 caused Russia's national power company to cut off electricity at a strategic base where nuclear missiles stand on high alert.
Nuclear missile silos do not lose power.
The armed troops marched up to the substation and turned the power back on.
The national energy company United energy systems cut power in January 2001 and February 2001 at a number of military installations around Russia.
Kamchatka includes a Russian space forces monitoring center including a military installation that lost power.
In most cases where electricity was cut off, it was quickly restored.
The investigation has often shown that utilities and the military were tugging at each other in a war that forced the military to spend the funds on electricity power instead of diverting the money to other uses.
Some of the budget cuts include building a General's residence in the country.

Brazil implemented a law allowing the air force to target drug-trafficking aircraft in Brazilian airspace.
The US is concerned about liability if the civilian plane is misidentified.
Brazil has announced that the Air Force will begin shooting down aircraft used to traffic illegal drugs in Brazilian airspace.
The plan requires eight steps of precaution before an order to shoot down a plane can be issued.
Prior to the policy taking effect late in October 2004, the publicity campaign notified the ranchers and other people that they needed to file a flight plan.
The law permitting such action was originally approved in 1998 but President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of 1995-2003 has never put the policy into effect.
The United States dissuaded Cardoso from signing the decree out of concern that the downing of civilian aircraft could expose the US government and companies to lawsuits.
In April 2001, when a Peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentifying as a drug carrier and killed a Peruvian missionary and his children, the United States reduced support for an operation targeting drug-running aircraft.
A relative of the victim sued the US government and won a settlement because the US government provided intelligence and technical support for the operation.
A US State Department official stated that --
US law may forbid assistance to countries implementing the shooting down law under certain conditions.
The US agreed with Brazil's assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is very serious and increasing.
The US government is consulting with the Brazilian government on Brazilian law provisions.
Brazilian Defense Minister Jose Viegas stated that Brazil encountered difficulties in securing US support for the plan but that recent bilateral talks have led to the certainty that the Brazilian government will accept the decree without exposing the US to commercial sanctions.
Brazilian officials expressed hope that the US would endorse the policy before it went into effect.
In 2004 the US was scheduled to provide 10 million dollars in drug and law enforcement aid to Brazil.
Former Air Force chief and current director of the Air Institute at Rio de Janeiro Estacio de Sa University Mauro Jose Miranda Gandra stated that the government's steps were courageous but that the impact may be more political than practical because of the restrictions imposed by the Brazilian government.
Brazilian officials stated that the policy may not apply against aircraft with children on board.
Viegas stated that there needs to be a limit.
Gandra stated that the provision undermines the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to child-carrying drug smuggling aircraft and introduces the possibility of using kidnapped children as human shields.
Viegas stated in an interview in Brasilia that the government uses laws to dissuade more powerful drug traffickers from entering Brazilian airspace when they previously felt the air force was not a threat.
The Government's actions were prompted by deteriorating public security situations of increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro in particular.
The drug gang in Rio de Janeiro has more firepower than the police and has successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close.
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stated in a foreign correspondent interview in 2003 --
Policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security.
Some drug-running aircraft pilots feel so confident in themselves that they are immune to retribution that they gesture obscenely at pursuing Brazilian air force pilots.
Brazilian law prohibits the death penalty as punishment for criminal acts.
Some legal experts and other commentators have stated that the statute amounts to the de facto execution of drug traffickers contrary to government claims.
The daily O Estado de Sao Paulo stated in an editorial the week of 18-24 July 2004 that extreme measures raise ethical and juridical problems exceeding any potential benefit.
The Air Force commanders' administrative decision applies extrajudicial penalties.
These people have gained the power of life and death over crew and non-regular passengers.
Brazil inaugurated the SIVAM radar system in 2002 at a cost of 1.4 billion dollars that will allow the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansive Amazon region.
The system uses American technology.
Illegal flying initially declined by 30% due to concerns about improved track capabilities for traffickers, but subsequently reaccelerated.
Brazil recorded 4,128 unauthorized flights in 2003.
Some of these flights are innocent violations by ranching people flying between plantations in the Amazon.
Viegas stated that there has been a significant increase in deliberate violations of Brazilian airspace by drug smugglers who are apparently aware of the government's inability to retaliate.
Rio de Janeiro's most notorious drug dealer boss Fernandoinho Beira-Mar was captured in Colombia in April 2001 in a drug-gun pipeline involving left wing guerrillas.
The northern Amazon corridor of Brazil has become an increasingly busy and essential route in the global drug trade and is used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
The reported route from Colombia to Suriname runs across the northern tier of the Amazon and is one of the most important routes for supplying cocaine to Europe through drug and gun smuggling.
Colombia is the only country currently with a policy of targeting drug trafficking aircraft.
Colombia is a source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the United States.

International; weapons; leader; military
The Venezuelan president's weapons deals with Russia, curbs on military cooperation with the United States and plans to train as many as 200,000 Venezuelan civilians to repel a possible superpower invasion have worried the United States and domestic critics of the Venezuelan president.
The United States and domestic critics of Chavez are worried about Hugo Chavez's weapons deals with Russia, his curbs on military cooperation with Russia and his plans to train as many as 200,000 civilians to repel an imperialist invasion.
Chavez insisted the move was purely defensive and borne out of the need to update obsolete military hardware and to protect Venezuela from nations that might want to control it.
Venezuela is the most prolific petroleum producer in South America.
Chavez's domestic opponents scoffed at the idea that the US would ever invade Venezuela and charged that Chavez was truly intent on arming huge cadres of loyal reservists to protect him from any internal uprising and pose a militarized counterweight to US influence in Latin America.
Cuba's leader Fidel Castro was a major ally of Chavez and grew closer to Chavez.
Chavez's detractors in the US government say that even more trouble could arise from Chavez's strategy to restructure Venezuelan democracy in the image of Cuban-style militarized socialism and foment left-wing revolutions throughout South America by purchasing arms and indoctrinating civilian militias.
US military strategists say they are increasingly concerned that the radical moves inspired by Chavez could foment such a revolution.
The political mainstream in Latin America has shifted leftward since the late 1990s.
This shift to the leftward is largely a reaction to perceived failures of free market economics.
A leftist was elected to lead Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador and Venezuela.
Chavez supporters at home counter that the United States has a long history of open and covert intervention in Latin American domestic politics and that it has no right to question Venezuela's defense preparations.
Carlos Roque Espinoza Leon said the Venezuelan people have never asked US marines what they are doing.
Venezuelan pro-Chavez defense specialist Espinoza Leon is a member of the Venezuelan National Assembly.
Espinoza said that Peru has 500,000 rifles and no one is saying anything.
Espinoza said no one is complaining that Colombia is the most militarized country in Latin America.
Espinoza said US history is full of aggression in Latin America.
Espinoza said the Venezuelan people must do whatever is necessary to protect the country.
Chavez is famous for saying that the so-called Venezuelan Bolivarian revolution was peaceful but armed.
Chavez was elected for the first time in 1998 and an independent poll by Datanalisis rated him with 71 percent popularity.
Venezuelan military analyst Alberto Garrido said Chavez is looking to his allies in Russia, China and Iran to promote a multi-polar world to counter US dominance and encourage grass-roots movements in Latin America to throw off the influence of the US government.
Lorenzo Campos is a farm owner in the state of Anzoategui in northern Venezuela and a reservist training.
Campos said the Venezuelan people want the world to know that they are not prepared to attack anyone and that the Venezuelan mission is protected.
In May 2005 the Government of Chavez announced details of a deal with a Russian firm to purchase 100,000 AK-103 assault rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition for 18 million dollars and a technology transfer to Venezuela to manufacture the rifles.
The deal worked out at 186.22 dollars per rifle.
This price is considerably less than the price of the same weapon ordered by US mail, which is $825 to $850.
The Venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 Russian helicopters, 10 Spanish transport planes and 6 Venezuelan naval craft.
A Venezuelan official said the government was negotiating with Brazil to buy around 24 air support and training planes.
Chavez insisted and even his most staunch military critics here agreed that the purchase was essential to update old weaponry such as the decades-old FAL military rifles from Belgium.
Retired General Fernando Ochoa Antich said it is exaggerated to say that Chavez is engaged in arms build-up.
Ochoa was defense minister in 1992 when Chavez, then a lieutenant colonel, launched a failed coup.
Ochoa stated that Venezuela has not made an arms purchase in 25 years and said Chavez has not aggressively bought weapons as a threat to his neighbors.
Ochoa said that Venezuela has never bought arms from Russia before and suggested that Chavez would buy Russian arms to become independent of the US.
Ochoa asked why Chavez bought the calibre popular with subversion forces in Latin America and stated that Chavez's political support for radical leftist movements made him a continent-wide menace.
The US Pentagon openly questioned what Chavez was doing with the old FAL rifles and whether he could share weapons or ammunition with Latin American guerrillas.
The US government provides no evidence that Chavez has armed or funded left-wing insurgencies.
Colombian FARC guerrillas and their military specialists say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and have no interest in old Belgian rifles or Chavez's assistance.
A 2003 US Defense Intelligence Agency study published in 2003 reported that more than half of the weapons seized from Colombian guerrillas from 1998 to 2001 were of foreign military mark origin.
implying that corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military may be aiding guerrillas.
Domestic Chavez opponents may be more distressed by the ideological indoctrination of the military and new civilian reservists, as critics have said.
In early 2005 Chavez called on the revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist the superpowers and said that the first step in resisting the superpowers would be training between 100000 and 200000 volunteers to back up the active duty armed forces in the years to come.
Military analysts estimate the number of active duty armed forces in Venezuela is 83000.
The people's defense units were created in the neighborhoods, state companies and the Free University established under Chavez, and reported directly to the President.
The Government insists that the reserves support the armed forces and do not act as a fifth column in a possible Coup against Chavez.
Espinoza said reserves should not be used for troops that would shock any political party and each person should decide his side in a civil war.
General Julio Ramon Quintero Viloria is the reserve commander.
In an interview Quintero said the armed forces hoped to train 50000 civilians over the second half of 2005 and could train 300000 more in 2006.
Quintero said the Venezuelan people do not want to be colonies of any empire and must be ready for any possibility.
In June 2005 100000 reservists and the Venezuelan navy engaged in a massive war game to repel an invasion by a stronger country.
40 employees of state oil companies with 1200 soldiers participated in similar exercises in June 2005.
Chavez's supporters here warn of asymmetrical warfare.
Unsymmetric warfare is a term coined by US military strategists to describe conflicts in which there are no equal combatants and the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
In the past 5 years the US government has given Colombia its most military aid of 3.3 billion dollars.
Chavez loyalists fear that the US government could instigate a proxy war with Colombia to oust Chavez and control the oil from Venezuela.
A senior US official dismissed in an interview the notion that the US government wants to invade Venezuela as completely and utterly nonsense.
The official said the Chavez side wishes to make a negative relationship because it is politically calculating that Mr. Chavez will reach power by constantly confronting the US.
Another development that troubled the United States was Chavez's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises.
The US military has had the Cooperation Office at a Venezuelan fort for 50 years.
Chavez shut it down in 2004.
5 US military trainers and students participating in exchange programs were ordered to leave the country in April 2005.
Analysts say Chavez is likely trying to indoctrinate his own public and armed forces.
Analysts say it is not proof that Chavez is using those forces to aid leftist revolutions elsewhere.

The North Korean government may be preparing to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step towards disabling the reactor by December 2007.
On 18 June 2007 Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Christopher Hill stated that the North Korean government may be preparing to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor as the first step toward disabling the reactor by December 2007.
Hill is the head of the United States negotiations on North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
Hill stated that efforts to dismantle North Korea's stalled nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the 16-17 June 2007 weekend when International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors were invited to Pyongyang by Pyongyang officials to talk about verifying and monitoring the shut-down.
Hill stated that the shut-down was long anticipated following talks with Chinese negotiator Wu Dawei.
Hill stated that the shutdown could happen in weeks, not months.
The Associated Press reported that on 18 June 2007 the IAEA stated that the team would visit Pyongyang the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which inspectors would verify the shut-down.
Hill stated that IAEA inspectors are holding talks with Pyongyang officials regarding sealing the reactor including installation of television monitors at the site.
North Korean officials refused to proceed with an agreement to begin decommissioning the Yongbyon reactor in February 2007 until funds worth 25 million dollars were transferred to North Korea from a Macao bank linked account held in Macao.
The money was frozen after United States officials accused Banco Delta Asia of complicity in financial crime against North Korea.
The funds were wired to the New York Federal Reserve Bank on June 14, 2007 after months of disagreement over the method of return.
The funds were supposed to be sent to Russia's Central Bank before being transferred to North Korean government controlled accounts at North Korean commercial banks.
Hill stated that steps to recoup lost time in financial transfer organizing were being talked about by Russian, South Korean and Japanese disarmament negotiators the week of 17 June 2007.
The discussion also involved setting a timetable for the resumption of talks between the 6 nations on arms control.
Under an agreement reached in February 2007 North Korean officials pledged to shut down the Yongbyon reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for 50000 tons of fuel oil.
In the next phase of the agreement North Korean officials declared all nuclear programs and disabled all facilities in return for further 950000 tons of fuel oil.
Hill stated that the next phase of the agreement could be technically concluded by December 2007.

A leading arms control expert has criticized the new nuclear activities plan released by Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency of the U.N. as ineffective and dangerous.
On August 27, 2007 Iran and the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a plan to resolve the issue by December 2007.
The issue has been unresolved for four years.
The plan is meant to allay suspicions about Iran's past nuclear activities.
The Agency official stated that the plan was a breakthrough.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated at a news conference in Tehran on August 28, 2007 --
The investigation into Iran's nuclear activities is now closed.
None of the other members of the International Atomic Energy Agency are cooperating as well as Iran is.
Iran is a nuclear nation.
Iran has a nuclear fuel cycle.
Iran has not succumbed to international pressure to curb its nuclear project.
Iran's nuclear project is for peaceful purposes.
The United States and some European nations believe Iran's nuclear project is to make nuclear weapons.
Several Western Governments and leading arms control experts have stated that Iran is attempting to avoid further punishment by the U.N. Security Council.
The western governments include the United States and France.
Government and experts believe Iran is attempting.
The arms control process is slow.
The question of Iran's past violations of the treaty was avoided.
Physics Professor David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security stated --
Iran's claims cannot be verified.
The International Atomic Energy Agency does not have access to people, documents and sites.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has lost the right to question further.
Unusual development has set a bad precedent.
The International Atomic Energy Agency may have been fooled because they were eager on the deal.
The International Atomic Energy Agency's plan was announced.
Iran has resolved the question of its past plutonium experiments without explaining why.
Senior Fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies Mark Fitzpatrick stated --
The International Atomic Energy Agency's plan is superficial.
The International Atomic Energy Agency's plan drew out negotiations for many months.
The International Atomic Energy Agency's plans may leave Iran with incomplete and misleading answers.
The International Institute for Strategic Studies is located in London.
Plutonium is a material that can be used to make nuclear weapons.

The Nuclear Suppliers Group's list shows Iran has been denied approximately 75 requests for nuclear-related material since 1998 on suspicion that the material could be used to build a bomb.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group's list shows Iran has been denied approximately 75 requests for nuclear-related material since 1998 on suspicion that the material could be used to build a bomb.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group of 45 nations is an offshoot of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and is charged with monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes is not directed toward military use.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group is composed of technologically advanced countries.
According to a mission statement by the Nuclear Suppliers Group countries will act on an individual basis to block trade that violates export controls devised to maintain international cooperation in peaceful use of nuclear energy.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group has no enforcement power beyond to notify companies when they violate their guidelines.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group keeps the data private and meets in large secret meetings.
Most of the denial of the purchase has been since 2002 and is a result of intervention by members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
Diplomats from countries interested in exposing the extent of Iran's efforts to acquire so-called dual-use items that could be converted to weapons production avail themselves of the trade-denial list.
The list is to be available only if the diplomats and countries are not identified.
The list names companies from Australia, Finland, Sweden, United Arab Emirates and Iran that have prevented the deal from being carried out because the items are suspected of being military useful as a sales item.
The items on the list offered to sell in a block deal include nickel powder, petrochemical plant components, compressors, steel flanges and fitting, electron microscopes, radiometric ore sorting machines, valves and tubes, laser drilling rigs, mass spectrometer and a nitrogen-producing plant.
Iranian end-use organizations include the Iranian government and Atomic Energy Organization, power companies, engineering companies, oil refining and gas companies, aircraft industries, schools and universities, engine manufacturing companies, mineral research centers, helicopter support companies and a plasma physics center.
Diplomats stated that the 75 denials represented only 7 of the 45 member states' actions.
Diplomats stated that the actual number of denials of sales of dual use products to Iran is much higher than 75.
Western diplomats stated the government in Tehran was using front companies to receive and convert technology for weapons production despite the continuing standoff with Iran over Iran's nuclear program.
Iran has signed the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but is not a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

The official website of Iraqi Shiite leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani includes a defaced and blocked website.
On the defaced website, the group "XP" stated that any website containing material contrary to Sunni teachings would be hacked.
Iraqi religious leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani's official website was defaced and blocked in a sectarian-motivated cyber attack on related Shiite sites.
It is not clear when the attack began, either in the morning on September 18, 2008 or in the morning on September 19.
Al-Sistani's website went offline on the evening of 19 September 2008.
Another website related to one of Al-Sistani's religious organizations is www.al-shia.com.
The alternative address to www.sistani.com is still in operation.
Iran's Fars news agency stated that the group "XP " blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite-related sites on September 18 and 19, 2008.
The hacking claims and Iran's assertion that the group is based in the United Arab Emirates cannot be independently verified.
Several Iranian news sites stated on September 19, 2008 that many of the attacked web sites related to the Shiites and Iran were normal operations again.
The statement signed by the group "XP" was posted on Al-Sistani's home page of his web site and stated that the attack was carried out by a Sunni Muslim.
The statement said --
The group named "XP" carried out similar attacks on other Shiite sites in the Persian Gulf and Iraq.
As they did with other Rafidha sites, the "XP" group erased the sites.
Rafidha means "rejectionist" and is an insult used by Sunni extremists to describe Shiites.
Al-Sistani has promoted sexual deviance and Iran's agenda in Iraq from the time he was born there.
Any website with material contrary to Sunni teachings will be punished.
The statement also consists of a YouTube video clip by American comedian Bill Maher ridiculing Al-Sistani's fatwa on whether certain sexual intercourse positions are permissible for married couples.
The office of the Ayatollah in Najaf declined comment on the cyber attacks.
Fars reported that the counterattack was carried out against two major Wahhabist web sites belonging to the puritanical strain of Sunni Islam which is dominant in Saudi Arabia.

Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large arms cargo approached a deal to release the ship.
The question emerged amid questions regarding arms shipments en route to Kenya and possible clandestine deals between Kenya and South Sudan.
Maritime officials and people associated with Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large arms cargo on September 25, 2008 stated on October 8, 2008 that the pirates may soon collect their ransom.
The parties came close to reaching a deal that would have paid the pirates millions and freed the ship after a difficult negotiation that several people involved in bazaar-style haggling liken to.
Somali businessman Ahmed Omar stated that the pirates had agreed to a ransom of approximately 8 million U.S. dollars from the ship's owners and that the ship could be freed on October 8 or 9.
Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on Somalia's coast.
Kenyan maritime officials stated that critical details have yet to be agreed.
One such detail involves the pirates' request for guarantees that the United States armada currently encircling them will not arrest or attack them.
An anonymous Kenyan maritime official stated that such negotiations are complex and involve more than financial aspects.
The official stated on October 8, 2008 that progress was being made and that the parties were approaching an agreement.
The pirates initially requested 35 million U.S. dollars and then reduced it to 200 million U.S. dollars.
Pirates have consistently expressed willingness to negotiate financial figures.
More than 25 ships were hijacked in 2008 off Somalia's coast for a ransom typically of 1 to 2 million U.S. dollars.
The pirates on board the Ukrainian ship stated that once payment of US dollars and a 100 dollar bill is received the ship and its cargo on board as well as the 20 sailors on board will be released.
The original destination of the arms shipment on board the Ukrainian ship is in question.
The Kenyan government claimed the weapons on board were from the Kenyan military shortly after the freighter was hijacked on September 25, 2008.
Ships en route to Kenya's main port of Mombasa.
Weapons on board the ship included 33 T-72 tanks, 150 grenades, 6 anti-aircraft guns and large quantities of ammunition.
Subsequent evidence of weapons being clandestinely dealt with by Kenya for the separatist region of southern Sudan emerged.
The deal is most likely to remain secret unless the pirates hijack a ship and begin speaking to the media via satellite phone.
Ukrainian officials are adamant in denying any wrongdoing.
A Ukrainian diplomat in Kenya named oliveh Belokolos stated --
Ukraine does not or has no plans to supply any arms to the Government of South Sudan.
All appropriate paperwork was validated.
Ukraine will abide by all United Nations rules and arms control agreements.
Ukraine inherited enormous stockpiles of weaponry after the collapse of the Soviet Union and is now a major arms dealer.
Kenya's deal with Ukraine is considered suspicious because Kenya relies most on the United Kingdom and other Western countries for its heavy weapons supplies.
Kenyan politicians demanded answers and called for several commissions to examine the situation.
Southern Sudan is an autonomous region currently increasing its military and using Soviet-designed tanks.
The United States military stated that the priority was to ensure that the ships were not unloaded with weapons and that the weapons were not sold to Islamist insurgents in Somalia.
The pirates denied having any weapons interests and claimed they were unaware of the tank being part of the cargo when they hijacked the ship.
Last week a pirate spokesman named suduule Ali stated in an interview that his sole interest in the deal was money.

Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban have cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of funding for the insurgency.
Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban have cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of funding for the insurgency.
Costa said this to reporters last week as the U.N. Drug Office prepared to release its latest survey of Afghanistan's opium crop.
The survey shows that poppy cultivation is in much retreat in much of Afghanistan and is overwhelmingly concentrated in the seven provinces where the insurgency remains strong, most of which are in the south.
The survey was issued on November 27, 2008.
The United Nations found that the amount of land devoted to opium in Afghanistan has been reduced by 19 percent but the total tonnage of opium produced has dropped by just 6 percent.
The study stated that high output per acre is attributed to a good growing season in the south.
The heavily irrigated southern region is an area where the Taliban maintain a strong presence in 5 provinces and systematically encourage opium cultivation to finance their insurgency for several years.
The U.N. estimates the insurgents made as much as 300 million dollars from the opium trade last year.
Costa said a lot of the war effort could have been funded with between 200 and 300 million dollars.
The Taliban have produced far exceeding world demand in successive bumper crops of opium.
Costa said the result would be a glut that would depress prices by approximately 20 percent.
Costa said there is evidence that the Taliban, drug lords and even some farmers are stockpiling opium despite the fact that prices have already collapsed.
The increased amount is also in process in Afghanistan.
Costa added that insurgents hold a significant amount of opium.
Costa said there was as much as a surplus of as much as 11,000 tons, or more than twice the world's demand over the past three years, and threatened to devalue their stockpiles.
The United Nations found that Afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008.
World demand is estimated to be about 4400 tons per year.
The Taliban are taking a passive stance in cultivation this year and are less pressuring Afghan farmers to plant opium poppies.
This then supports the current price.
Costa is an Italian diplomat serving for six years with the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.

The South African government imposed a ban that prohibits people from inside or outside the country from being recruited as mercenaries or assisting foreign military.
The Citizen newspaper stated on 6 October 2001 that South Africans are not legal to be involved in mercenary activities or render assistance to foreign militaries inside or outside South Africa.
The Citizen stated that on October 5, 2001 the South African Foreign Ministry announced that the South African government had imposed a ban on mercenary activities following reports that 1000s of Muslim military trainers had enlisted to leave South Africa to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan.
The report claims that the Muslim group Muslims against Illegal Leaders has claimed that 1000s of Muslim men with military training have volunteered for service and have received the backing of local businessmen.
The report claimed that all the men were Muslim and had been trained in the military for over 18 years.
The group is based in Cape Town and is called Muslims Against Illegal Leaders.
The Muslim Judicial Council refuted the report.
The South African Foreign Ministry stated that South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act prohibits people from inside or outside South Africa from recruiting mercenaries or assisting foreign military.
The South African Foreign Military Assistance Act means that people are not allowed to offer military assistance to any state, its organs, groups or other country without the permission of the National Conventional Arms Control Committee.
The South African Foreign Military Assistance Act means that foreign military assistance can only be rendered in accordance with an agreement approved by the National Conventional Arms Control Committee.
The South African Foreign Ministry stated that any person found in violation of South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act or failing to receive permission to participate in foreign military activities can be prosecuted for the violation or failure and sentenced to a fine or imprisonment (or both).

Former Peruvian spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos was convicted of taking illegal control of the National Intelligence Service during the tenure of ex-President Fujimori.
Montesinos was sentenced to 9 years and 4 months in prison on conviction.
Montesinos plans to appeal the sentence.
Former Peruvian spy chief under ex-President Alberto Fujimori Vladimiro Montesinos was convicted on July 1, 2002 of illegally taking control of the National Intelligence Service when he was only supposed to advise the spy agency.
Montesinos was sentenced to 9 years and 4 months in prison for abuse of authority.
The sentence also ordered Montesinos to pay a $ 3 million fine to the state as compensation.
Anti-corruption judge Saul Pena stated that Montesinos admitted to charges of abuse of authority.
This is the first ruling in more than 50 charges against Montesinos including corruption, drug trafficking, illegal arms dealing and human rights violations.
Montesinos is alleged to run a network of bribes.
The leaked videotape showed Montesinos bribing a congressman to switch to the government and triggered an event that culminated in Fujimori's resignation in November 2000.
Fujimori is accused of dereliction of duty and embezzlement and has imposed exile in Japan since resigning to avoid Peruvian legal action under the protection of dual nationality.
Montesinos fled to Peru in October 2000 but was captured in Venezuela on June 23, 2001.
Montesinos heard the sentence at the Callao Naval Base where he has been imprisoned since 2001.
Montesinos stated that he would consult a defense lawyer before appealing.

Hong Kong police are trying to prevent the triad or transnational criminal syndicates from engaging in criminal activities.
Hong Kong police recently smashed a transnational theft syndicate specializing in exploiting youngsters to commit various crimes, a cross-border criminal syndicate and a local triad gang specializing in exploiting youngsters to commit various crimes.
In the opinion of the Oriental Daily News, the Hong Kong police's recent efforts to cut down 5 of the so-called leaders of the Triad branch within 3 weeks of the event, or so-called leaders of district teams within a short period of time, demonstrates the determination of the Hong Kong police to eradicate criminal activities.
Hong Kong police have recently worked closely with the Public Security Bureau in Guangdong for intelligence exchange and carried out a series of raids and operations.
On 18-24 July 2002 Hong Kong police cracked down on the activities of the triads including drug trafficking, illegal arms possession, theft, burglary, robbery, sales of pirate and obscene records, and duty-duty cigarettes, as well as trafficking in dangerous drugs.
Police were reported to dispatch over 100 staff on 24 July 2002 to storm a propitiatory dance and wine party organized to settle a dispute between two groups of the Triad at a disco nightclub in Mongkok, Kowloon.
The police eventually arrested 3 Branch leaders and 14 core members of the Triad.
Police sources confirmed to Xinhua News Agency on 25 July 2002 that all 17 people arrested were still detained for questioning.
A Hong Kong police source was quoted as saying that the operation has succeeded in netting all 17 people as a result of the police's efforts to infiltrate relevant gangs here.
Police sources also intimated that the crackdown by Hong Kong police followed more crackdowns by other gangs of the triad.
The Hong Kong police's efforts to fight off organized criminals have involved active cooperation with mainland Chinese police and other regional police.
The first so-called target conference of the International Drug Enforcement Conference in the Far East will be held in Hong Kong in early July 2002.
Hong Kong was chosen to host the event following an IDEC decision made at a meeting held in Bolivia in February 2002.
Some 42 senior anti-narcotics officers from mainland China, Hong Kong, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United States met.
The Hong Kong Police's internal news letter recently reported that the Conference's aim is to provide a flexible and forward thinking environment to share information and take positive actions against organized criminal drug traffickers.
In particular, the exchange of intelligence between Hong Kong police and mainland Chinese police has been intense.
A delegation of 11 members of mainland China's National Narcotics Control Commission recently visited Hong Kong to study how the police here enforce their anti-narcotic laws.
Deputy Director of the Bureau of Narcotics Control of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security Chen Cunyi chaired the team of 11 people, Hong Kong police briefed the team on the enforcement actions carried out in Hong Kong, and head of the Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau Ip Lau Chun led the team.
Hong Kong police also exchanged mutual concerns with the National Narcotics Control Commission of China and discussed a number of issues including investigations into drug trafficking and money-laundering activities.
After meeting with Hong Kong Deputy Commissioner of Crime Yam Tat Wing, the mainland parties closed their visit and discussed further proposals to combat cross-border drug trafficking activities.

Peruvian military documents disclose links between former intelligence head Montesinos and drug trafficking.
A document signed by a high-ranking former Peruvian army officer disclosed on July 25, 2002 mentions drug trafficking links and may further compromise the situation of former head of Peru's National Intelligence Service Vladimiro Montesinos.
According to a front-page story in Peru's national newspaper El Comercio daily Montesinos may have authorized drug deals with the leaders of the military in the Alto Huallaga region to find leaders of the rebel group Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
Alto Huallaga is located northeast of the capital, Lima.
The story is based on a final report by the Attorney General's Office.
The Attorney General's Office report collected accusations documents handed over by unnamed generals in the Peruvian army.
El Comercio said that in 1992 the then-President Alberto Fujimori put in effect an intelligence operation called Scorpion to fight off terrorism and drug trafficking in the Amazon.
Several agents infiltrated the group as part of the planned Scorpion to gather information on the commanders of the main rebels and drug traffickers.
There was also an additional order for cocaine to be transported to cover up the agents.
Montesinos is a close advisor to former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.
Fujimori resigned in November over a bribery scandal and is now in prison in Lima for allegedly being connected to the scandal.

The French foreign minister has characterized the recent raid on the People's Mujahedeen in Paris as part of the fight against terrorism.
On June 3, 2003 French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said the French government was considering cracking down on Iran's armed opposition group the People's Mujahedeen of Iran as part of a terrorist operation.
De Villepin said on France Info radio that the People's Mujahedeen has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks in Iran and that this dimension of terrorism cannot be hidden.
De Villepin said the arrests were a matter of justice and that there was no diplomatic factor in this affair.
De Villepin said that the French would take strict action based on justice and determined to try all in the name of fighting terrorism.
On 22 June 2003 French police raided the headquarters of the People's Mujahedeen northwest of Paris.
The People's Mujahedeen accused French authorities of being part of a deal with the Iranian government to carry out the operation.
The Iranian government denies this claim.
The judiciary is now investigating 17 members of the Mujahedeen for alleged links with terrorist organizations and funding terrorist activities.
Some 160 people were initially detained as police cracked down on over 10 locations including the People's Mujahedeen's in France.
During the police raid, a map of Paris, a street related to the United States embassy, a bulletproof jacket, transmitters, more than 200 computers and about 9 million American cash dollars were seized.
The People's Mujahedeen is classified by the United States, the European Union and Iran as a terrorist organization.
The People's Mujahedeen was formed in the 1960s by young Iranian college educated people and is described as a left-wing Islamic organization.
The People's Mujahedeen staged terrorist attacks inside Iran in the 1970s and killed several US military personnel and civilians working on defense projects in Tehran.
The People's Mujahedeen is part of a broad coalition that initially supported the Iranian revolution and participated in the 1979 takeover of the US embassy in Tehran.
The People's Mujahedeen have fallen out with the government and have since the 1980s built military bases in Iraq and political bases in Europe.
In recent years the People's Mujahedeen has claimed responsibility for assassinating several Iranian regime officials.
This assassination included the August 1998 assassination of former director of Tehran's Evin prison Assodalah Ladjevardi and the April 1999 assassination of Iranian army chief commandant General Ali Sayad Chirazi.
