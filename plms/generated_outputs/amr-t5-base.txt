Support the person who started the thread resolutely. I replied by composing a poem.
Pledge to fight to death to defend the Diaoyu Islands and the related islands.
Fishing boats are bumped into the fleet. The evil little ghost of Japan stirs up trouble and unrest. They show their wolfish appearance again with stolen hearts and an arrogant form.
Never go back to that time when we appeared humiliated when we signed the treaty. Be strong to China. Sharp a sword and shine a knife. Burrow the enemy in the approach.
September 11, 2010
I agree with the analysis of the thread starter. If war really came, I would like to be Hua Mulan to protect our homes, defend our homeland, and spread the prestige of China.
I very much wish to be born during that passionate upsurge of Mao Zedong's Long March to lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguish all the enemies of China who are wrong, and spread our dragon prestige.
How much tolerance do we have for Japan?
As I said to my fellow Citizens.
Hello everyone. We all know about the September 18th incident, but now again Japan has premeditated another incident on the sea, another Lugou Bridge incident on the sea.
Surprisingly, Japan defied the strong condemnation of the whole world and openly invaded our sacred territory, the Diaoyu Islands.
As we all know, the Diaoyu Islands have always belong to China. For historical reasons, our original belongings have become controversial.
My fellow citizens, ours is ours and why is there a need for negotiations? So Japan went even further, wanting to create facts about occupation? Can we allow this? Absolutely not!
To my fellow citizens, Japan's militarism brought a grave disaster to the Asian people.
Especially China has suffered the ravages of Japan for several decades long.
Unit 731 of Japan's military experimented cruelly with extremely brutal methods on human bodies of Chinese, Koreans and other countries in Northeast China. The Nanjing Massacre added to the ancient capital a layer of blood that never faded away. The bloody big battles in Hengyang and Changsha bared the bones of the dead over 1000 kilometers and killed everything.
For instance, to my fellow citizens, there are too many instances of heinous crimes committed by Japan in China, which are difficult to record without exhaustion of all the bamboo strips.
Just like those million decedat souls who lost their lives wandered over the Pacific Ocean and found it difficult to rest in peace.
So all those who experienced that era still remember that era vividly. Even our younger generation also cried tears down our cheeks and our blood boiled indignantly any time we turned to this page of history and read it.
Japan actually wants to reverse the verdict on its aggression history now, so it will wake up fellow citizens and Chinese in Asia.
We have to go face to face with the pain of looking back at this 100 years of shame. Even if the issues of history are not resolved, let's create and choose history.
We are not afraid of responsibility. Although the territory is small in relation to matters of dignity, the interests of a country and of a national unity guarantee honor no matter what the wind and cloud change. We cannot let our native land be separated, even if it is scarred and wounded.
My fellow citizens, the advent of the 21st Century means to the Chinese nation that we are not only beset by difficulties inside, but that we are under pressure from the outside, and that we are facing many challenges.
What way should we go from the Taiwan issue, the issue of Tibet, the issue of the South China Sea, the surrounding environment, or the issue of foreign forces aggressive against China?
What do fellow Citizens do? Please look at the world map, the crescent-shaped encirclement suppresses our breath, strangles our development, and covets our national territories.
We never fear the enemy, but we don't want to make them our enemy. We don't fear war, but we don't want war.
We must urgently arrange arms and strengthen all military forces on land, sea and air.
China has flourished several thousand years ago, but has never had the ambition to expand its territory outward.
We follow a foreign security strategy philosophy that applies benevolence and virtue because we don't impose what we don't want on others.
The tolerance and liberalness of a country is like the tolerance and liberalness of an individual, we must not hurt ourselves, but must avoid hurting others.
Tolerance is certainly not fear, sincerity does not have to be cowardice.
Exempting Japan from war repair because of WWII served benevolent peace.
To my fellow citizens, the People's Heroes Monument is a condensed history of a Chinese nation striving for continuous improvement.
The magnificent solemn posture represents the sacred expectation of peace.
My memory strings of thoughts are occasionally agitated by the sprang up, in my mind, many tragic and heroic scenes of soaring spears and armored horses.
Integrity thought goes through that yellow historical page like I saw Kangxi, a famous generation-ruling emperor, who alone contemplated the achievement of territorial unification in his audience hall hundreds of years ago, and also Abraham Lincoln, a former U.S. president who wandered in the dark of the great hall thinking about the integrity of the Union.
To be peaceful in the world, forgetting war is certainly dangerous. To my fellow citizens, if we want development and peace, we must never blindly exercise forbearance. In modern times, the Boxer Protocol of nation-betraying and humiliation aggravates China's poverty and backwardness. Falling behind leads to bullying.
Where does peace come from that is weak?
We must focus on national defense education, build up a great wall in the hearts of 1.3 billion people, establish a full range of systems capable of attacking and defending the nation.
The best attack defense is to strengthen forces that can engage in ultra-long-range attacks and improve combat capabilities in all aerospace at great distances and depths. On the premise of avoiding influence on national economic development, increase investment and construction in the defense industry, accelerate the modernization and internationalization of military equipment, establish elite high-quality high-tech divisions.
The battle horn is about to sound and the people are already fully equipped and ready to go.
We accomplish nothing without the support of people, but we are all powerful without their support.
To my fellow citizens, it is time for us to say no to other people. Therefore, we must achieve.
1. Establishing guaranteed funds, improving working environment and working mechanisms, and recruiting back to China hundreds of thousands of IT professionals who linger in the United States and around the world and are emigrating from the United States and around the world.
2. Create a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
3. Manufacturing 5000 various kinds of advanced combat aircraft.
4. Accelerating research and deployment of high-speed ICBMs with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles that could break into a missile defense system.
5. Resuming nuclear experiments and establishing military forces in space.
6. Retain 1,000 nuclear bombs equivalent to tens of billions of tons of trinitrotoluene and install nuclear warheads on all short- and medium-range missiles when needed.
7) Retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines capable of inflicting three devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy.
8. Your commitment to not using nuclear weapons first is abandoned.
9. When national security is threatened, the right to a pre-emptive strike is retained.
As fellow citizens of mine, if we are only confident in ourselves and willing to improve ourselves, we can strive for strength. Qin Shi Huang unifies China. Zheng Chenggong recovers Taiwan. We must carry on the far vision, insight, and strong will of our predecessors with responsibility.
Now that piece of land, trembling far from its motherland's embrace, shakes, moans, and calls. To fellow citizens, let us carry forward the unfulfilled wishes of previous generals, moving forward courageously.
When I read history, heaviness and anger simmer in my heart to the point of national concern. Although I was born in a cloth gown and included among the common people, I was willing to volunteer my service to our country for the sake of its prosperity and once again its splendidness, and I would not regret even if I died. Showing my sincere patriotic heart to heaven would be adequate.
I, in classical Ci - form, have composed the poem here to voice my heart's aspirations.
Paint a deep red lip.
Protect the Diaoyu Islands.
We bitterly lost our Ryukyu Islands.
How can we allow the Diaoyu Islands to fall on other countries?
100 years of vicissitude.
Smoke and clouds chase a flying wave.
The youngest brother is still a tender youth.
Wandered all directions, and was bearded of seals.
Look over the flag.
We brandished our weapons and crossed towards the east.
Let the horses drink the Pacific Ocean.

If I were a Taiwanese person, the title of the other article was "A book for Taiwanese compatriots, I had a dream, the need to build a memorial museum or a temple for Taiwanese national heroes, how will we tolerate it, China will never bebegging for the Olympics if it is expected by the country, but if we forget about the hardships of history, if we are a Taiwanese person, the only nation, the wealthy country, the wealthy officials and the poor, disgusting Ren Zhiqiang shut his filthy mouth, the state may decline, when the sport is overdeveloping, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity, pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity pity
Why didn't we fight for little Japan?
What are the Chinese still tolerating?
They even rode our heads.
Are the Chinese guts still doing this?
We should tell the whole world that others cannot bully China at will.
It's time to show our strength. China has been calm too long.
Our citizens' lives are currently all too carefree. Officials are too extravagant.
We already have no cohesion now. China needs to start a war. A harsh slap in the face of a country following the United States' rear.
Let them know that the US is not a panacea. If we win, we can increase China's influence, improve citizen cohesion, we can clean out incompetent bureaucrats and make trash get out. If we lose, let China have new blood and update, let China get up!
China, go!
I suggest that China strengthen its guard of the Diaoyu Islands, guard the Diaoyu Islands daily, protect the fishermen and our sovereignty. If Japan dares to invade our territory by military force, we will fight a small scale war to defend ourselves, regardless of the cost. China cannot lose.
We need shows in life, but really p. is to show someone you are embraced by.
I just passed by.
This is the whole society, including the stars.
Damn, not sexy.
It's totally unacceptable.
Just a cheap entertainer, agree. Their reputation in feudal China makes somewhat sense.
Their lives look glorious.
a group of 9 professions
Life is hard.
Shocking.
That is normal. And whores are always heartless and wrongeous performers.
They want money, not faces.
Look for a wolf with glasses near Ms. Fan. You know the actor must drink with him if he isn't forced out or even framed.
-Sonofa-bitch
As long as there's something loveliness to eat.
Life is like a show, you have to look at the script to know what will happen. No one is easy.
All are somebody.
On all 360 walks of life, the top scorer of the Imperial Examination. What effort and endeavor is so behind the top scorer of the Imperial Examination. This humiliates the word "vermicelli".
hahaha
Overdo.
Reality.
Shoot those hooligans.
Cheap performers.
Cheap performers.
The entertaining circle is dirty. All the men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
It's not easy for those stars to be females. Pity them, but who to blame.
Everybody does this. How can you make money if you don't?
Women are proud when in front of others, but when they stay alone they are in a melancholy mood.
To put it plainly, nowadays stars are just popular prostitutes from ancient times. They are now famous prostitutes, so drinking with some high officials or even sleeping with them should just be normal.
Stop talking to other people. Just be yourself.
What should we do in the future? Capability alone is not enough for success? Are we too faced with such a hard choice?
More suffering is in dispute disguised as a glorious look.
It's not so bad because they're just playing in their circles out of sight, out of mind.
But the old guy, Zhang Jizhong, behaved like a hooligan in his circle, also thought he was virtuous with no talent. He made TV series while having nothing to do to wreck the people of the whole country.
Both will take what they need.
When can China have a pure innocent girl?
The story is now very shocking in the entertainment world. There are rumors that Hsu Yuki was forced out because he refused to drink the guest arranged by the company and had to switch to working with a lawyer assistant to make ends meet.
Super stars with much envy often encounter social engagement or circumstances they are not welcome to but must join in with.
After all, they can't make decisions about many things because it has to do with many aspects and interests of many people.
Sometimes, as we ordinary people seem to imagine, a very normal dinner party for stars isn't that simple.
Stars have a lot of contracts and their sources of money are rolled out and tackled well. Forced out or even framed, her heel comes without a well-tacked tack.
The second kind of smart star female is always holding a very high degree of integrity and sternly rejecting all such invitations.
The second kind of person is good at playing tricks and achieving their objectives with their seed money.
There are rumors that even some super star females have won her first role this way.
After drinking some alcohol, advertisers or show sponsors may have the chance to lie on the shoulder of a star female, feel her chin, or kiss her cheek, or adopt the most endured attitude.
They are the very people in the lower 9 professions.
Those stars are just pretending and are actually living a much better damn life than this.
Just a cheap entertainer, agree. Their reputation in feudal China makes somewhat sense.
Agreed.
Oh well, it's not easy to be an actor.
They deserve it, they asked that.
Nothing has dawned on me as easy as it was.
The women are birds and beasts, the men are worse than the birds and beasts.
braawwk.
braawwkkk
It won't take long.
In late 2004 the circumference of Route 288 opened, running around the southwest quadrant of the Richmond New Urban Region.
It already changes the development pattern because it gets worse and causes localized traffic congestion around its exits.
The Richmond Times-Dispatch told a story today about the impact of the Huguenot Trail in Powhatan County.
Will Jones reported that traffic on one section of the Huguenot Trail has more than doubled since the opening of 288.
Speed and accidents surge as well.
So far this year 17 accidents near an intersection with Winterfield Road have been reported, up from 12 in all 2004.
Virginia Department of Transportation resident engineer Dale Totten noted that the Virginia Department of Transportation has 4 more road lane(s) at about $13 million.
Of course VDOT does not have the money to construct roads in the Richmond region.
Because VDOT spent all their friggin' money on 288 with local politicians and boosters.
Where is Homer Simpson when you need him?
Doh, this is a major moment.
As we predicted, Route 288 will generate residential development in a scarcely populated area around all its exits, overtaxing the local roads of the country.
Other people choose where to work and where to live, but limited access highways can relieve traffic for drivers driving back and forth between Chesterfield and Goochland counties.
And they created traffic congestion in the new place.
I was surprised only by this rapidity.
Even I think it could lag 3 or 4 years.
Think about the liability if Route 288 creates a liability for all of its exits, since Route 288 already created a $13 million road construction cost at just this one exit.
Another prediction.
The need for new road improvements soared after a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval for a mega-commercial project at the intersection of 288 and major roads.
We can see well before the end of the decade that the unfunded liabilities will zoom well past the 400 million dollars it took to build the original highway.
Says the idea to a brainiac who thinks Route 288 is such a great idea.
Thanks for nothing.
I think we could spend 400 million elsewhere better.
I don't think you should blame 288 for creating those people.
If they were enough to create traffic congestion in new places, what would be the alternative?
Additionally, is traffic congestion in the old place an issue?
Now you understand how people like TMT in Fairfax feel.
I usually take a pro-road position.
But 288 is definitely excess, with glaring needs in other parts of the state.
Richmond has virtually no traffic.
The rush hour is 30 minutes long.
And you give them a beltway through large rural areas.
It's a road to nowhere.
Just think, another Potomac crossing facility, or road improvements desperately needed in NOVA could be spent with this money.
In addition to the injuries, the rest of the state helped pay for 288 of the 288 when the budget deal was done last year, adding insult to injury, so it wiped out the debt, Virginia Centrist.
It would be very nice if you all would oblige us.
Not much sense though.
The old problem is the same.
Get ahead of need and get accused of causing sprawl.
Building in a place where needs are already acute, you can't pave your own way out of congest, claim that you can't pave your own way out of congest.
Anonymous
That's a fair point.
5:26 makes a good point.
But this situation hammers home the validity of the state audit report that found the CTB and VDOT funds for transportation projects were based on the best lobbyists rather than a comprehensive plan for state transportation.
I submit that this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated.
And Senator Chichester and his toadies are pouring more money into this flawed institution, making this worse.
What is the purpose of the transport expenses?
In Virginia, it was for the benefit of private business plans, not for the public interest.
You're all dead wrong.
No less than Walter Stoch stated that the intention was to pay money for economic development on the 288.
Come on folks.
I don't understand your point TMT.
When are the last time you're stuck in traffic, whether you're from or not some sort of business?
The whole point of the road seems to me to be to facilitate the public's interests in getting into and out of private businesses.
The business support needs are overwhelming despite the Sunday drive, the trip to the location of my grandmother, and of course the soccer game.
No wonder we suffer from congestion problems because our road expenses do not match the increase in business or state domestic product.
If we recognize that the road is a primary benefit to businesses, then we should do two things.
Businesses pay more for what they pass on to us (of course) on our transportation bills and be incentivized to locate where they least stress the system, even if that means more overall travel.
Why is it so hard to understand?
The solution is a functioning human settlement pattern and a balance between the capacity of transport systems and the demand for travel generated by land use.
Spin all else.
EMR
TMT said it was for the benefit of private business plans and not to serve the public interest in Virginia.
I don't see the point of this statement, it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public's interests above all else.
I think they are tightly intertwined, virtually the same.
There is obviously a local problem with this cookie dough being lumpy.
But eventually, if we demonize businesses long enough, we will all find ourselves working for the devil in aggregate.
I don't see the point in claiming a solution is a balance of ever changing dynamic nature.
Even you see the rail to Dulles as being a positive because it is a job center that promotes bidirectional rail demand.
I agree.
In fact, that's all it takes to build it on your own.
All I'm saying is that the exact same logic should be applied to the road.
They should have a destination at both ends so that we can use our investments to the maximum.
We need more places to get closer to the balance we say we need.
Here's a reality check.
I drive past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
I commute back and forth from work on the Huguenot Trail.
I've never seen anything remotely like a traffic flood.
It's in a 55-mph zone, where are 75-100 cars in the morning?
The Huguenot Trail widening plan is already in place due to heavy demand on the Chesterfield side, new schools and a whole bunch of development that had existed years ago and had been funneled through Robious Road before.
288 would be wonderful for those of us who actually use it, rather than bottlenecking Powhatan and west Chesterfield because of its lack of roads.
We could develop economically and work closer to our lives.
You might think that is an irrational use of land.
I have no desire to live in any city.
I refused to work in the downtown area.
I refuse to use mass transit that is unsafe for female commuters working long hours.
And I happen to like the development of a large lot.
I don't understand exactly how I was supposed to keep horses on a 1/4 acre lot.
1 gallon of gas can go for $10.
And I still pay to live in the country.
Many people genuinely prefer horses, hunting, gardens, certain types of small businesses, which makes them unable to live in urban cores.
This infatuation with city life truly baffles me.
Anonymous 6:37 You have every right to live in a country if you wish.
But you're not right, the rest of the state is underwriting 400 million in highway construction, making it easier to shop and get to work.
Other things that could have been spent $400 million have consistently been overlooked in the debate on 288.
If the money is applied to other road press projects or even to non-road projects (god forbid), much of the traffic congestion can be alleviated.
Ray Hyde, I would direct my comments to the investors lobbying for the road to be placed near where the property is owned and to the incompetent system that will fund these requests regardless of whether they are linked to the master transport plan or not.
I'm 24 and have a 2.5 year old mother.
I've been breaking up with my son's father since August.
I wanted to start dating other people and the father said he had nothing to do with my son.
He is very possessive and controlling, but he doesn't have that right because we are together.
Right now there is too much going on in his life and he thinks we can work, although I've told him several times that I don't love him and he doesn't love me.
I want him there for his son, but he doesn't need me too.
But he had no one. His family didn't get along with him and they had their own issues.
I don't want to be miserable anymore, and I'd be happier if he was around longer.
I don't want him there for his son, he's a good father, or at least trying to be.
I believe that every child needs both parents whether they are together or not.
But he thinks no one can have me if he can't.
What would I do if I moved on from my life?
It's very bad your ex threatened you by using your son.
You don't have to give in to that, it's just escalated if you give in to that.
You have the right to live your life and be happy, so don't cave in because he's threatening.
If he really loves his son he will see him regardless, but this is just a typical control method used by people like him.
Other people said it would kill me if you left me. Did it get through to you?
Date.
Meet all kinds of people.
Do what you want.
If he had voluntarily walked out of both of your lives, you would probably be better off without him.
I agree. One other thing, it's not his business to date or not.
I didn't tell him.
Not because he made a threat, but because he was not concerned about your personal life.
Can you document his threat?
You really need it.
Quit taking his calls and make him leave voice mail.
Make him email or text you.
Keep that record.
Get a lawyer and get divorced.
Try legal aid if you can't afford one.
Tell your ex that all communications need to go through a lawyer.
Bus drivers, tillers and food delivery people want exactly the change.
They don't realize you don't get a change pile from the bank?
Someone has to take a note somewhere?
People get lazy.
I'd like to be as near as I can because I don't like counting copper all day.
Take a £20 note on the bus and they'll just tell you to get on the bus cause hell they're lazy.
It is illegal to pay a certain amount with a load of coins, you can only pay something like 30 pence with one pence.
Hello, I started university in September, but obviously didn't immediately gel with it like most people did.
However, as I am very introverted, shy, especially anxious, all the rest of the time, I know it will take some time to adjust.
All my housemates and I went out the first night here and it was the hardest thing I ever had to do.
When I was sober, I went by myself to a student union bar.
But more to the point. Here is the fact.
After about 5 months here I haven't enjoyed university. I'm disillusioned with the course, I don't enjoy set projects, I don't like course delivery much.
University is making out to be much better than it seems to be.
I'm starting the first term badly, the student finance was delayed adding to my stress level and I was so worried I couldn't make progress in work, that in conclusion all was piled up.
I was assigned a counsellor at uni and I saw him for about 5-6 weeks in a block session and it didn't really work out as I never opened up to him, to be honest.
Only HALF the heart.
Now I'm loaded with work around my neck, having to hit a major deadline, feeling depressed and all the time feeling miserable.
I no longer have a counsellor, you can only have so many sessions at a time, and I doubt it will help me much this time if it doesn't already help me.
I lack motivation, don't feel comfortable with my lecturer, I feel I want to give in but can't bring myself to give in because I ended up with a job that ended in death and aspiration to be someone.
I would rather die than be uninformed and not live the life I want to, and worsen the matter by dropping out of uni.
I'm 21 and will turn 22 this year, and don't have much time left to fail, so I have something to do.
I've failed college once and did another course so I could get into uni. I don't want to go through the system over and over and consistently fail.
Can someone please give me some advice?
Go and see your doctor, see if there is a way to get your deadline extended so you can try and ease the pressure a bit.
Send an email like this post to your tutor and they'll consider the mitigation circumstances. Don't worry, they've seen all of the admittances before, some are much more uncomfortable. I know, because I'm using my work in the university administration department.
Break your work into manageable chunks.
Concentrate on one bit of work at a time : the first and obviously most urgent assignment.
Don't shut off your house mates and do well because you've been trying new things from the very beginning. Now keep it.
I would recommend you go see your doctor too.
If you're always an anxious person, you may benefit from speaking to someone. My friend gets NHS therapy because of anxiety so it's really normal.
Try to get the deadline extended. I'm sure your university will allow it, be honest.
Keep strong and keep living on, it's getting hard.
My mum got divorced. She had a horrible time with my step-father and the new freedom she found sent her round the bend.
She had epilepsy, manic depression and a huge anger problem.
She is constantly horrible to me.
When I was home I couldn't cope with her outburst and the hateful and nasty remarks she made.
I was an 18 year old with a 95% bursary, studying full time in a high-pressure private school in sixth form at the point of break.
I couldn't work at home because she shouted at me.
Then I angered my teachers.
One minute she was lovely, like having my mummy back, then the next minute she turned into the most spiteful human being.
I haven't passed my A2 exam and I have already accepted defeat and that this year of my life will make me fail.
How can I come back to this? The university offered me the most amazing offer, but I couldn't even accept it. I've never made a grade.
I wish I could wipe her out of my life. Without her, things would have been so much better.
But then I thought I was just being selfish.
But sure doesn't mean my life is like this, does it?
It should have been so much better.
But I feel like I am not controlling this downhill spiral.
And I don't know what to do.
Thanks for reading.
Nice vent.
You can't get her section because of that.
Does she even have a mental illness history or diagnosis?
You sure don't know you won't get a good grade, so if you can accept the place.
Life throws things at you all the time.
If there isn't someone in your family, there is an outsider.
I had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad before I came to uni for 8 years and honestly, it was the only way out that I was here.
If you really want out, work hard.
It really sounds like if she can't consistently give you support, you need it somewhere else.
Can you call Childline or something like that?
You can go to the library on Saturday and study there for a good 8 hours.
Can you go to your friend's house to form a study group?
You want her sectioned because it's a bit of a pain in the arse and you're blaming it on all your problems?
I know how you feel.
My mum was spit from hell too.
I highly recommend taking up smoking.
Oh, tsr grew up and stopped nagging. It was a joke.
I think I've become much weaker over the past couple of years and my personality has been dulling down in the process of trying to make friends with some people at uni.
But being nice to people over leads them to believe they can say or do whatever they want to to me.
They show absolutely no respect.
For example, I say hello to someone from uni and they ignore me, but 30 minutes later they decided they wanted me to help them with some work and I gave them.
It causes a lot of anger and distress in my life and really starts to affect my concentration in university.
Has anyone got any experience handling this sort of thing or how to go about gaining some respect again?
You just said no.
If you're not particularly comfortable with it, you'll gradually do it.
Sorry, but I'm busy, maybe you're starting.
Of course you don't go over the top with it to go in the completely opposite direction.
If you think no, mind you.
When they start to realize you don't bend over backwards for them, they start to respect you more.
Well, this really is such a bad attitude. Of course you can have respect if you are nice but not so nice that you just let them do anything to you. But that isn't nice, it's a fool.
I don't know if anyone has read this, but I just feel desperate and need to tell someone.
I left home in September and started at uni. I was incredibly anxious to do this, but waited until I got here to think about it. I'm here now and here for over two weeks. I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward.
Since moving to secondary school, I have been struggling emotionally for the majority of my life, although I lost my dad around the age of 9, and I have always blamed it on how I feel. I have had two counselling periods in my life, roughly 15 months from December 2009 until this year around March.
At the moment I feel like the problems of my life are uncredible and make my ever-lower self esteem doubtful. I am unable to concentrate on work and often find myself very quiet on social occasions, doubting myself on anything and everything.
My 2 counsellors didn't diagnose me as having depression and suggested I didn't suffer from it, but it was a huge worry for me as my dad was in a depression that caused him to die and therefore his suicide.
I've tried to solve my problems before, found exercise and meditation particularly useful, and also tried things like self-help books and tapes. However, I generally feel this is what I live for. I've wasted one chance of being alive, one chance of being a young man. This feeling was beaten away on me.
I simply don't know what to do and never follow through when I think about what to do. My friends often say I'm lazy and I can't disagree a lot of times. I feel like people are trying everything anyone can do to help and I fail time and time again.
I'm sorry for anyone who has read this jumbled mess, I feel a bit like a self seeking moaner, but I truly feel despair.
It is common for existing feelings of people to become more intense when they are in a new situation and feel pressured to socialize with strangers and fit into new roles such as university students.
I am not a health professional and I can only speak from my personal experience, so I strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about how you feel and worry about depression.
Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to university, so you're definitely not alone there. But really, I would recommend getting an appointment with your counselling service at your university. It really doesn't matter if anyone tells you you're depressed or not. The label isn't as important as your experience. Meditation and exercise are really helpful, so try to do them. But for you to get somewhere you need to engage in help and general life, don't beat yourself up because you feel unmotivated to do anything at the minute. A lot of people feel similar
Good luck.
I think a lot more people feel the same way as you, but medicate them by using friends. Probably not as such, but being around friends when you're depressed is definitely better than being alone and depressed. If you fancy a chat either way, feel free to message me privately.
My focus is on you, my idol. Assist someone, someone who comes from a bad background and ends up successful, happy, having a family, marrying, etc. You don't want them, but someone you admire and respect.
You focus on what you have achieved in life. You don't state what you studied or why you did it indeed. You want experience. Your mum wants you gone. You need a degree for the career you want.
Either way, you sum up why you're there and work your bottom off to get the best grades possible because when you get your degree you have something you can say like "hey, I didn't fail" and "it worked hard and I passed."

I hope this helps.
I'm not pretty autistic (not being diagnosed as dyspraxia but thinking it was a misdiagnosis) but nearly all the time walking on my toes.
I'm more comfortable with it.
Because walking toes seem so random and aren't always indicative, what makes them decide that toe walking is a sign of autism?
Well, I may have some signs of something on the autism spectrum, but who doesn't have one or two?
You guys know what I mean.
Walking on the toes can be an autistic symptom.
The headache may be a symptom of a brain tumor.
Feeling tired a lot may be a symptom of leukaemia.
Symptoms don't always apply, but they are worth noting - in a lot of cases they are clearly symptomatic, so there will never be nothing to be noted about this instance.
I walked on my toes, but I was born with a strange under-curled toe that had to be straightened by surgery 2 years ago.
My brother is autistic, but I haven't noticed him either, but the spectrum is so broad and I probably have mild Asperger's, so I have communication problems and don't pick up social reactions/body language.
But then I don't have a proper diagnosis, and you may even have some symptoms, which doesn't mean you have a certain condition.
I've been told not to walk on my toes for years, so I don't walk on my toes much.
I have dyspraxia.
If so, you may be dyspraxic or have a short tendon.
Now that I find it more comfortable, people who do dance/gymnastics/ballet etc will get drills on it.
I haven't read too much about random symptoms like that.
Hello, I'm a 12-year-old girl who is going to be 13 in 2 days and is addicted to self harm.
When I was 7 I started slitting each individual finger with a scissors and from that day on I never stopped.
It got worse as I had a scar on my leg from having it slit with a stapler with my ex-boyfriends name because I wouldn't stop cutting if I bled.
I have several slits in my arms.
They healed and then I cut myself with staples and razors that robbed the school.
When a cut could not be found I took around 5 drops of paracetamol and other drugs and I took them with lager and vodka.
When I wrote this I was really tempted to cut my arms or burn myself.
I'm an addict. I'll cut again when one heals.
I think about it every day.
I'm 12 and I'm already sick of my life.
This is sourced from my dad who left when I was 7 and didn't want to know me anymore.
He just cared about his little girl, his wife and his new life where I didn't want to.
My best mate died when I was 10.
I was in a relationship with a 16 year old boy and was forbidden from speaking to him due to events and age differences.
My mum also suffers from bipolar and I have depression.
I don't want to stop.
I don't care what is done to me. I want to do it again and again to torture myself. I hate myself.
But I love my best mate loads and he means the world to me and if I do anything he will.
I didn't tell him but he found out.
I don't want to hurt him. I don't want him hurting himself.
What do I do?
Thanks for reading.
Are you on any drug or getting any therapy?
You should talk to your school nurse or GP and tell them what's going on.
You can trust a school teacher who can tell you.
People can help you if you tell them.
If you keep it bottled up inside it will only likely get worse.
Trust me, it's better to get these things as early as possible rather than let them get even worse.
Please do not do this.
I was 17 last year and started self harm (mainly arm cuts) but stopped it a few months ago.
It's hard but you can do it.
I feel so much happier, but seeing the scar reminds me of how I felt at that time, and how strong it was that I wanted such a thing done to me.
It's also strong and you can do it. Writing poetry and keeping a journal is what it finds salvation.
Self harm is addictive, but it can be overcome.
Remember self harm does not define who you are.
You can overcome it.
In the past year I've found myself always checking my belongings every time I go out, especially at uni, to make sure I don't lose or leave anything behind, so I thought I'd get a form of OCD.
I often have to check twice a go and can't resist doing it again after 30 seconds for some reason.
Why is this?
Am I crazy or something?
It's most often when it's carrying many things, but rarely, and it checks even daily. Is this to any extent an OCD?
What can I do about this?
I often get very anxious, which sort of goes away after 15-30 minutes if I don't check, but is so much that I can't wait that long.
I feel or feel doomed if I lose my wallet or phone.
I just wish I could go out every 2 minutes without worrying about leaving or losing something.
I don't really know what to do and I'm afraid to go to a GP.
They probably never heard of some compulsion like this and I just don't know what to do.
Do any of you have a similar ritual?
People think I'm crazy, but it's very strange how difficult it is to get out of this.
What can you advise me?
I used to do this on my way to college. I had a list of items I knew I had on me and used to compulsively check on the bus.
I'm having more severe anxiety now and this is a warning sign so just try to wean off the habit when it's relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor but also tell yourself not to keep checking this thing. I know it's easier said than done.
Don't worry about that, the doctor saw a much worse case.
I did an emoticon about OCD in today's psychology class.
The only way you can get rid of it is to just avoid compulsive acting, so don't check if you're losing something and just leave it there.
Despite your anxiety level increasing over time, it will gradually decrease, hopefully your OCD will disappear overtime.
That just sounds to me like you're over anxious rather than having a really bad OCD.
I am very obsessed with getting up 20 times a night to check in particular the locks on all my houses.
Sometimes I am convinced they aren't locked, although I know they are.
I think when obsession really starts interrupting your daily routine it becomes a real problem.
Don't worry, you're definitely not crazy and I'm sure your GP understands the issue.
I went to therapy also for other reasons and they encouraged me to pick and stick to the obvious 20's for my check and cut down.
I thought it was a good idea to teach and I'm still OK if I check 5 or 20 times.
So far I'm a lot better and I think anyone who wants to will definitely improve.
I'm usually pretty calm about things and like to take them as they come and don't worry too much.
But in the past month or two I have found things to be really anxious and I haven't been talking about mere nervous feelings out of the blue.
I began to feel irrational panic over a variety of things I hadn't worried about beforehand, and that didn't even cross my mind as something that rang an alarm bell in my head.
I'm not sure if this is because of a lifestyle change (going from a free-care student to an unemployed graduate) or if it's a sign of other issues, but it begins to bug me because it affects my confidence and happiness.
I speak to a few people, including my parents, but the same people think I should go into a random phase and hold off acting until the serious problem is clear.
So, what's the best thing to do?
speak to your doctor about it and see if the anti anxiety pill can take off the edge.
Will I see if I can speak to a counsellor?
Or should I take the advice of a close person around me and just keep an eye on anxiety until it becomes a problem?
Well, I shouldn't be starting to try to look at your anxiety, it makes me tense and more likely that you'll panic. There's a circle of demise.
As soon as you start feeling a bit panicked about anything, I recommend trying to focus on something that will make you smile or feel happier.
If you can't do that, or when you start feeling panicked, you get a laugh from one of your friends. LOL, it worked for me, and I suffered random panic attacks.
I'm just starting to worry about tiny things really, although not as severe as you from the sound of things.
Talking to someone else about what makes you anxious helps, I find.
I found myself mentioning my worries to my mum and seeing how she was reacting to the situation with the calm I should have, which made me feel better about it, knowing that it wasn't a big deal and I didn't need to be anxious about it, but perhaps in a way that wasn't moaning.
But if it gets worse, go to the doctor.
I have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that may prevent him from leaving the house and doing things because he is so worried about what might go wrong with things.
The doctor gave her the medication and it made her much better.

The International Atomic Energy Agency reached an agreement with Iranian officials stating that there are no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding Iran's nuclear program and activities.
U.S. and European officials suspect that efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce an atomic bomb are masking Iran's civilian nuclear energy program.
U.S. and European officials suspect that efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce an atomic bomb are masking Iran's civilian nuclear energy program.
U.S. and European officials could impose the fourth round of sanctions against Tehran when the U.N. Security Council considers the issue of Iran's nuclear energy program most likely in September 2007.
The International Atomic Energy Agency distributed limited copies of the IAEA report before its 35-member board meeting on 11 September 2007.
The findings reflect an agreement reached on 070821 between the Agency and Tehran which was made public by Iranian officials beginning the week of 070812.
The accord said there remain no issues and no ambiguities regarding Iran's nuclear program and activities.
According to a Reuters news account IAEA reports say there have been significant steps forward in working plans.
A senior U.N. official was quoted by Reuters as stating that the Iranian government's efforts to enrich uranium are slowing.
The IAEA report stated that Iranian officials must continue to build confidence in the scope and nature of Iran's present and future nuclear program.
Iranian officials stated on 30 August 2007 that officials will cooperate with the IAEA to prevent further rounds of international sanctions.
Iranian representative to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to the Fars news agency in Tehran that the report emphasizes that there are no signs or evidence indicating that Iran's nuclear activities have been diverted and that all of Iran's nuclear material has been audited.
Some non-proliferation experts stated that the IAEA has ceded too much to Iran.
In a critique published the week of 19 August 2007 the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security experts David Albright and Jacqueline Shire wrote that the idea of closing the file violated fundamental safeguard principles and that the agreement did not specify that Iranian officials would provide the IAEA with access to key people, facilities and documents needed to verify the IAEA's answers to questions.
Independent experts stated that Iran's latest agreement with the IAEA to allow inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information was short of Western demands to halt production of concentrated uranium which could be used in bombs.
U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that Iranian officials have not met any international obligations with regard to the nuclear program but that reports may offer some new details or insights into Iran's program development.
Casey stated that continuing the nuclear program to move forward shows that the Iranian regime is continuing to defy the international community.
Most non-proliferation experts in the West state that the 070821 agreement contains little that could dissuade policy makers in Washington, London, Paris and Berlin from moving forward with another round of Security Council sanctions.
Experts stated that many previously resolved transparency issues that were reported to have been resolved in the agreed on 070821 should be resolved.
Executive Director of the nonpartisan Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl G. Kimball stated that the agreement addresses problems the Iranian government is pursuing in terms of technology and capability that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material.
Kimball stated that the Iranian government is designed to deflect criticism and pressure and claim progress has been made.
Iranian officials stated that more sanctions could be reduced by collaborating with inspectors.
The Security Council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on Iran despite the limitation of the U.S. demand for the sanctions due to pressure from China and Russia.
In an interview with Iranian state-controlled televisions Soltanieh stated that the reports and measures make any other international intervention including the Security Council irrelevant and unjust.

The Nuclear Suppliers Group distributed a document outlining Israel's proposal to allow the transfer of nuclear technology to non-proliferation states.
The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for India to engage in nuclear trade.
Israeli officials have convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the transfer of nuclear technology to states that do not sign on to non-proliferation rules.
Countries that do not sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty including India, Israel and Pakistan are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade including the purchase of reactors, uranium fuel or yellowcake.
In March 2007 a document outlining Israel's proposal was distributed to 45 members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
The Israeli presentation was made on a non-paper that allowed for official denials.
A letter from the NSG chairman said on 17 March 2007 that an Israeli presentation was offered in the context of a debate with Indian officials over an exemption bid.
India and Israel are the only nations that have not signed the treaty to qualify for admission to the NSG.
Israel's plan offers 12 criteria for allowing nuclear trade with non-Traded States.
1) Indicates Israel's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and says that States should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if they apply stringent physical protection, controls and accounting measures to all nuclear weapons and facilities in Israel, and to all sources and special nuclear materials in Israel.
The documents were circulated on Capitol Hill in September 2007 as the Bush administration worked toward an agreement with Indian officials.
Executive Director of the Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl Kimball stated that the Israeli document could affect the debate over India.
Kimball stated --
At NSG, the dynamic is that the country officials don 't want obstacles to India being the largest country, and the United States being the most powerful country.
A consensus on India would be difficult to reach at the NSG meeting in November 2007.
Israel's proposal gave some officials in some countries reasons to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
Israel's record of following international nuclear rule is good and better than India's.
The Bush administration rejected Israel's proposal despite ties between the Israeli government and the U.S. government.
The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win an exemption for India to engage in nuclear trade.
President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice view the pact as an important part of the administration's foreign policy legacy.
The deal is controversial in India and Congress must give approval.
With the most negative effect on the election year, delays in winning approval for the Indian deal could negatively affect the administration's foreign policy legacy.
State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that the U.S. government views the Indian deal unique and does not see it as a precedent for any other country including Israel.
Israeli embassy spokesman David Siegel stated that any suggestion that the Israeli government would demand exemptions or link the effort to any other issue including the Indian debate is grossly inaccurate.
Seigel stated --
The Government of Israel has never asked NSG to be exempt from nuclear supply guidelines or made any request specifically for Israel.
Israel is recognized as a full fledged adherent to the NSG guidelines.
The Government of Israel urged NSG to consider adopting a multiple-tier generic approach to nuclear technology transfer based on criteria.
Some NSG officials have previously suggested an approach similar to the Israeli plan.
The non-proliferation regime would be considerably enhanced by modifying the NSG Guidelines in the line proposed by Israeli officials.

Ahmadinejad announced that Iran's uranium production capacity will be expanded.
Iran has refused to commit to halting expansion despite hinting that it could do so in future.
20080726 Iranian President Mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in Mashbad, northeastern Iran that Iran has expanded its arsenal of centrifuges producing enriched uranium to over 5000.
Ahmadinejad asserted that the expansion was the first since announcing Iran's approach to implement 6000 centrifuges in April 2008.
Iran has articulated a goal of 50000 centrifuges to be operated at an enrichment plant near Natanz.
The international community demanded that Iran halt production of nuclear material.
The media reports are different from the number of centrifuges Ahmadinejad has cited.
Iranian news agencies reported that Ahmadinejad stated that Iran has 6000 working centrifuges but that statement was later removed from the Internet.
Another Iranian news agency stated that Ahmadinejad referred to hundreds of thousands of centrifuges.
Experts discounted the significance of Ahmadinejad's claims because of the absence of information on centrifuge functionality.
The number of centrifuges has been stated by Western diplomats in Tehran under condition of anonymity as less important than the operation and efficiency of the machines but Ahmadinejad's assertion has hindered the resolution of the diplomatic standoff between Iran and the West.
Jeffrey G. Lewis, New America Foundation's arms control expert, stated that the New America Foundation is aware of Iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but does not know the status of the machines in operation.
Diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems hinder Iran's enrichment program.
Iran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program aims at producing electricity only because producing nuclear weapons contradicts Islamic principles.
The US, Israel, Europe and the majority of Western arms control experts believe Iran is pursuing the ability to immediately produce a bomb.
Experts stated that producing weapons-grade uranium from reactor-grade material is relatively simple.
Ahmadinejad stated that Western countries are still pursuing the resume of negotiations after Iran's resistance to demands to halt its nuclear activities.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana recently presented two offers to Iran.
a US-endorsed package of incentives to cease production of enriched uranium
During the pre-negotiation period of 6 weeks, Iran did not add centrifuges and the West refrained from promoting the 4th round of economic sanctions against Iran to the UN Security Council.
US officials have repeatedly stated that negotiations cannot begin before Iran can verifyably halt all of its enrichment-related activities but the Bush administration recently agreed to a proposed freeze and dispatched Burns to Geneva.
On 26 July 2008 Iran refused to respond to Solana's offer at a talk in Geneva attended by US undersecretary of State William J. Burns.
The talks constitute the highest level of diplomatic contact between the US and Iran in nearly 30 years.
Solana, Burns and the European envoys set a deadline for Iran's positive response before initiating new sanctions including prohibiting the sale of Iranian reconditioned petroleum products vital to Iran's economy.
Iranian officials refused to commit to stopping expansion or observing deadlines.
On 26 July 2008 Ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that Iran could potentially halt expansion in over 6 weeks with a number of centrifuges higher than previously expected.
Ahmadinejad stated that the number of existing and operating centrifuges will be consented by the West if it does not increase.
If the material is highly enriched, 5000 centrifuges could produce enough nuclear materials for power plants or atomic bombs.
6000 continuous-run centrifuges could produce weapons-grade uranium sufficient for 1 bomb in 6 months.
In May 2008 the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that Iran possessed 3500 operational centrifuges.

The diplomatic meeting in Paris concluded with no agreement to further steps to pressure Iran to halt uranium enrichment at its Natanz facility.
Diplomats stated to the media at a meeting in Paris on 13 November 2008 that officials from the United States, Europe, Russia and China have not reached an agreement to further act to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment at its Natanz facility.
Uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for nuclear power plants and produce fissile materials for atomic weapons.
The meeting on November 13, 2008 ended with no new measures announced.
After the meeting on 13 November 2008 the French Foreign Ministry released a statement declaring that the international community has reaffirmed the importance of a dual-track approach to diplomatic engagement with Iran and to work towards sanctions.
Russia and China are resisting new sanctions against Iran.
Russia and China have close political and business ties to the Islamic Republic of Iran and do not feel domestic pressure to take action against Iran.
The United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran have no close political and business ties and feel domestic pressure to act against the United States.
Russia and China hold the power to veto decisions of the Security Council.
Russian diplomat Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by Moscow's Interfax news agency as saying that parties had not struck a deal for sanctions against Iran at the meeting on 13 November 2008 and that Western countries favor sanctions against Iran but China and Russia do not support them.
Sergei Ryabkov will attend the meeting on November 13, 2008.
This week Iran released a significant report on progress at a heavy-water research reactor facility near Arak.
A heavy-water Iranian research reactor near Arak could eventually produce plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons.
The images from the satellite published by the Institute for Science and International Security show significant progress in the construction of a heavy-water research reactor facility near Arak from February 2008 to October 2008.
David Albright stated that a heavy water research reactor near Arak in Iran has evaded notice from the international security community.
David Albright stated that the satellite image said that the Iranian heavy water research reactor near Arak had made significant progress and had made progress from the building frame to a large finished facility over the past year.
David Albright is a former arms inspector and director of the Institute for Science and International Security based in Washington D.C.
Iran stated that Iran is pursuing nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research.
The United States and its Western allies suspect that Iran's production efforts have preceded its creation of a nuclear weapons infrastructure.
Production of low-grade uranium is legal under international arms control regulations.
Iran's latest nuclear technology development shows the complex diplomatic and technical challenges facing the incoming US president-elect Barack Obama's foreign policy team in taking on the task of stopping Iran from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons.
Last month while in power the administration of the United States President George W. Bush managed to synchronize American policies with European Union leaders, British, French and German leaders to press for tougher sanctions and diplomatic action against Iran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is expected to release a report criticizing Iran next week.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is a United Nations nuclear watchdog.
Hopes of imposing another set of United Nations Security Council sanctions before the end of Bush's term decrease as new initiatives on Iran's nuclear program do not emerge from talks in Paris on November 13, 2008.
Iran continues to work toward mastering nuclear and missile technology through diplomatic maneuvers.
Some Israeli officials stated that it was alarming that Iran this week tested a 2 stage solid fuel rocket with a range of 1200 miles.
Tel Aviv is less than 650 miles from Iranian territory.

A high-security Russian laboratory complex that stores anthrax, plague and other deadly bacterium faces losing electricity due to a lack of payment to the Mosenergo electricity utility.
A large repository of deadly anthrax, plague and other bacterium stored in a high-security Russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of Moscow threatens to lose electricity.
The electricity utility Mosenergo in the Moscow region recently arrived at a Russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity due to a lack of pay.
The Russian laboratory complex is a 90-building campus and served as a secret location for secret biological weapons programs during the Soviet era.
The incorrect headline in Izvestia stated that Moscow is threatened with a deadly virus from a regional Moscow depository.
The virus was not at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
There are every kind of deadly bacterium at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology that has been studied to use in the Soviet secret biological weapons program.
A large virus repository is located in Siberia.
Russian and Western officials stated that power cuts at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology are unlikely to result in any threat to public health.
Russian and Western officials stated that there is not enough certainty to be able to know why the loss of power at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is a threat to public health.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology has a quite reliable emergency protection system.
Nikolai N. Urakov is a long-time director of the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
The State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology works with Western scientists to convert complexes into biomedical manufacturing sites.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology was scared by this threat of sudden electricity shut-down because of psychological pressure of a kind.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that if power was shut down at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology scientists would have to destroy all the bacteriological experiments in a way.
General Nikolai N. Urakov likes the contributions of the United States and Western countries, which contribute about 60 million dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapon complex, to pay another 500000 dollars annually for electric bills and arrears at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
American scientists working closely with the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology stated that the Russian government is responsible for paying the State Scientific Center's electric bill.
Western aid to convert one of General Nikolai N. Urakov's bioweapon laboratories topped in 1997 when it was learned that Iran had offered to purchase experts from the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
It is known that Russian scientists and military leaders who now depend on Western finance to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons orchestrate the sense of crisis to increase finance.
American scientist Randall Lee beatty is working to convert the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
Beatty stated that this threat of electricity cuts at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is a crisis.
Randall Lee Beatty is the Director of the International Science and Technology Center.
Nikolai N. Urakov's General was approximately half of the budget of the International Science and Technology Center to support about 350 Russian scientists and technicians in biowarfare.
Randall Lee Beatty stated that it is known that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology has not been paying its electricity bill for 14 months.
Randall Lee Beatty stated that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is one of the world's most important archives of dangerous pathogens and that it would be a shame to destroy it because electricity utilities are not paying for it.
Approximately 3000 strains of bacterium are stored at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology and many of them are stored in cryogen-cooled liquid nitrogen-cooled casks isolated from the environment through layers of enclosures and oversize air handling systems that all depend on electricity for their functions.
Defrosting alive germs currently in a frozen state is the greatest danger of shutting down electric power at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
Biologic warfare expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies Raymond zilinskas stated that organisms are under a main threat not because of power cuts to the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology but because of the threat of escape.
Raymond Zilinskas stated that the bacterium was defrosted from the lowest temperature in the worst case and the cleaning up afterward was a real mess because it was not known whether all the bacterium had died.
Another example is the confrontation between the electricity utility Mosenergo and the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk where the basic imperative of capitalism concerning enterprise sustainability could dangerously clash with the old remnants of Soviet weapons science.
The Russian National Power Company cut off electricity at strategic bases where nuclear missiles stand on high alert due to overdue power bills in 2000.
The nuclear missile silo does not lose power.
Armed troops marched to substations and turned on power back on.
National energy company United energy systems cut power in January 2001 and February 2001 at a number of military installations around Russia.
The Kamchatka space forces monitoring center is one of the military installations that lost power.
In most cases where military installations have been cut off electricity, electricity will be quickly restored.
The investigation often shows that utilities and the military are tug of war that force them to spend money in budget funds rather than diverting money to other uses.
Some of the budget funds that have been cut at times include building country residences for the generals.

Brazil implements law allowing the Air Force to target drug trafficking aircraft in Brazilian airspace.
The US is concerned about liability for misidentification of civilian planes.
Brazil announces that the Air Force will begin shooting down aircraft used to traffic illegal drugs in Brazilian airspace.
The plan requires steps 8 and 8 of precaution before a plane shooting-down order can be issued.
Prior to the policy taking effect late in 041000, a publicity campaign notified the ranchers and others that they needed to file a fly plan.
The law permitting such actions was originally approved in 1998, but President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of 1995-2003 never put the policy into effect.
The United States dissuaded Cardoso from signing the decree because of concern that the accident downing of civilian aircraft could expose the United States government and companies to lawsuits.
In April 2001 the United States reduced previous support for operations targeting drug-running aircraft when a Peruvian jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed Peruvian missionaries and their children.
Victim's relatives sued the US government and won a settlement with the US government for providing intelligence and technical support for the operation.
A US State Department official stated --
US law may forbid assistance to countries implementing shootdown laws if certain conditions are met.
The US agreed with Brazil's assessment that the threat posed by drug traffickers is very serious and increasing.
The US government will consult the Brazilian government on the provision of Brazilian law.
Brazilian Defense Minister Jose Viegas stated that Brazil encountered difficulties in securing US support for the plan but that recent bilateral talks have led to certainty that the Brazilian government will accept the decree without exposing Brazil to commercial sanctions.
Brazilian officials expressed hope that the US will endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
The US is scheduled to provide 10200 million dollars of drug and law enforcement aid to Brazil in 2004.
Former Air Force chief and current Director of the Air Institute at Rio de Janeiro's Estacio de Sa University, General Mauro Jose Miranda Gandra stated that the government took courageous steps in measuring but the impact could be more political than practical because of the restrictions the Brazilian government imposed on it.
Brazilian officials stated that the policy may not apply against aircraft boarded by children.
Viegas stated that limits were necessary.
Gandra stated that the provision undermined the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug smuggling aircraft carrying children, introducing the possibility of using kidnapped children as human shields.
Viegas stated in an interview in Brasilia that the government uses more power to dissuade drug traffickers who previously entered Brazilian airspace without feeling threatened by the Air Force.
The deteriorating public security situation of increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in Sao Paolo and particularly Rio de Janeiro prompted the Government to take action.
The drug gangs in Rio de Janeiro have more firepower than police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close.
In an interview with a foreign correspondent in 2003 President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stated --
Policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security.
Some drug-running aircraft pilots felt so immobile to retribution that they made an obscene gesture towards the pursuing Brazilian Air Force pilots.
Brazil's prohibition against the death penalty as punishment for criminal acts is a question of constitutional law.
Some legal experts and other commentators stated that the statute amounts to de facto executions of drug traffickers contrary to government claims.
The daily O Estado de Sao Paolo stated in an editorial the week of 18 July 2004 through 24 July 2004 that extreme measures raise ethical and legal problems that exceed any potential benefit.
The penalty will be applied extrajudicially according to the Air Force commander's administrative decision.
These people gain the life-saving death power over crew members and non-regular passengers.
Brazil inaugurated a 1.4 billion dollar SIVAM radar system in 2002 that will allow the government to monitor air activity for the first time throughout the expansive Amazon region.
The system uses American technology.
Illegal flights initially declined by 30 percent due to concerns from traffickers about improved tracking capabilities but were subsequently re-accelerated.
Brazil recorded 4128 unauthorized flights in 2003.
Some of these flights were innocently violated by ranchers flying between plantations in the Amazon basin.
Viegas stated that there has been a significant increase in deliberate violations of Brazilian airspace by drug smugglers who appear to be aware that the government is incapable of retaliation.
In April 2001 Rio de Janeiro's most notorious drug dealer boss Fernandinho Beira-Mar was captured in Colombia on a drug-gun pipeline involving left-wing guerrillas.
The northern Amazon corridor of Brazil has become an increasingly busy route for the global drug trade and is used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
Colombia-Suriname is reportedly one of the most important routes for smuggling drugs and guns across the northern tier of the Amazon to supply cocaine to Europe.
Colombia is the only country currently with a policy of targeting drug trafficking aircraft.
Colombia is the source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the United States.

Venezuelan President's dealings with Russia over weapons, curbing military cooperation with the United States and planning to train as many as 2 million Venezuelan civilians to repel a superpower's possible invasion worry Venezuela and domestic critics.
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's dealings with Russia over weapons, his curbing of military cooperation with Russia and his plans to train as many as 2 million civilians to repel the possible invasion of the imperialist superpower have worried the United States and domestic critics of Chavez about the plans of former leftist military officers.
Chavez insists that the move is pure defensive and bears the overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect Venezuela from nations who may want to take control of Venezuela.
Venezuela is the most petroleum-producing state in South America.
Domestic opponents of Chavez scoff at the idea that the US would ever invade Venezuela and are in charge of the true intention of arming a huge cadre of loyalist reservists to protect themselves against any internal rise-ups and posing a militarized counterweight to US influence in Latin America.
Cuban leader Fidel Castro was a major ally of Chavez and was growing closer to Chavez.
Chavez's detractors in the US government said that the part of the strategy to restructure Venezuela's democracy in the Cuban-style militaristic socialist image that could foment a leftist revolution throughout South America could be even more troubled: Chavez's arms purchases and indoctrination of civilian militias would be a part of the strategy to restructure Venezuela's democracy and foment a leftist revolution throughout South America.
US military strategists say increasing concern is that the radical moves inspired by Chavez could foment such a revolution.
Since the late 1990s, the political mainstream in Latin America has shifted leftward.
The perceived failure of free market economics is largely reacted to this shift leftward.
The leftists were elected to lead Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador and Venezuela.
Home supporters of Chavez have countered that the United States had a century-long history of open and covert intervention in Latin America's domestic politics and said that Venezuela has no right to question Venezuela's defense preparations.
Carlos Roque Espinoza Leon said the Venezuelans never asked what the US marines would do.
Espinoza Leon, who is in Chavez's favor, is a defense specialist in Venezuela's National Assembly.
Espinoza said Peru has 500000 rifles and no one has said anything.
Espinoza said no one complained that Colombia is the most militarized country in Latin America.
Espinoza said the US history is full of aggression in Latin America.
Espinoza said the Venezuelans must do whatever is necessary to protect Venezuela.
Chavez famously said the so-called Venezuelan Bolivarian Revolution was peaceful but armed.
Chavez was elected first in 1998, and according to independent datanalisis polls, his popularity rated 71%.
Venezuelan military analyst Alberto Garrido said in Russia, China and Iran that Chavez is looking to his allies to promote a multipolar world that will counteract US dominance and encourage the grass-roots movements in Latin America to throw the influence of the US government.
Farmer Lorenzo Campos in the Anzoategui state in northern Venezuela and has been trained as a reservist.
Campos said the Venezuelans want the world to know that they are not prepared to attack anyone and that Venezuela is a mission to protect the country.
In May 2005 Chavez's government announced details of a 1.8 billion dollar deal with a Russian firm to purchase 100,000 AK-103 assault rifles each with 30 rounds of ammunition and to transfer technology to Venezuela to manufacture the rifles.
The deal worked out at $ 186.22 for a rifle.
This price is considerably less than the same weapon ordered via US mail for between $825 and $850.
The Venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 Russian helicopters, 10 transport planes and 6 naval craft from Russia.
Venezuelan officials said the Government was in negotiations with Brazil to buy around 24 air support and training planes.
Chavez insists, and even the staunchest retired military critic here agrees that the purchase is essential to updating the military's outdated weaponry, such as decades old FAL rifles from Belgium.
Retired General Fernando Ochoa Antich said it was exaggerated to say Chavez was engaged in arms buildup.
Ochoa was Defense Minister in 1992 when then-Lieutenant Col. Chavez launched a failed coup.
Ochoa stated that Venezuela had not purchased arms in 25 years and said Chavez had not aggressively bought weapons under threat against his neighbors.
Ochoa said Venezuela never bought arms from Russia before and suggested Chavez buy arms to become independent of the US.
Ochoa asked why Chavez bought rifle caliber popular with subversive forces in Latin America and stated that his political support of radical leftist moves made him a continent-threatening menace.
The US Pentagon is openly questioning what Chavez did with the old FAL rifle and whether he could share weapons or ammunition with the guerrilla forces in Latin America.
The US government provided no evidence that Chavez armed or funded the leftist insurgency.
Military analysts and specialists in the FARC guerrillas said the rebels had plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and were not interested in old Belgian rifles or Chavez's assistance.
A study published by the US Defense Intelligence Agency in 2003 reported that more than half of weapons marked by foreign military seized by Colombian guerrillas between 1998 and 2001 originated in Venezuela.
It implies that corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military may be aiding guerrillas.
The ideological training of new military and civilian reservists, according to critics, may more distress domestic anti-Chavez opponents.
Chavez so early in 2005 called for the so-called revolution unit to start preparing the public for resistance against superpower aggressors that Chavez said it would be the first step in this resistance to train 100 to 200 million volunteers to back up the active armed forces in the coming years.
Military analysts estimate that Venezuela's active-duty armed forces are 83,000.
The people's defense unit was created in neighborhoods, state companies and the Free University established under Chavez and was directly reported to the president.
The Government insists that the reserve supports the armed forces and will not act in a fifth column against a possible coup against Chavez.
Espinoza said the reserve should not be used for troops that shock any political party and that in civil war each side should decide their own.
General Julio Ramon Quintero Viloria is a reserve commander.
Quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50000 civilians in the second half of 2005 over the weekend and could train 300000 more civilians in 2006.
Quintero said the Venezuelans do not want to be colonies of any empire and must be ready for any possibility.
In June 2005 100,000 reservists and the Venezuelan navy engaged in a massive war game to repel stronger invading countries.
In June 2005 40 state oil companies and 1200 soldiers participated in similar exercises.
Here, a pro-Chavez circle warned against symmetric warfare.
Unsymmetrical warfare is a term coined by US military strategists and describes conflict between inequitable combatants where weaker sides employ guerrilla tactics.
In the past five years, the US government has given Colombia 33 billion dollars in military aid.
Chavez's loyalists fear that if the Colombian government were to oust Chavez and control Venezuela's oil they would be able to instigate a proxy war between Colombia and Venezuela.
In an interview a senior US official dismissed the notion that the US government wanted to invade Venezuela as completely and utterly absurd.
Officials said that the Chavez side wishes to make the relations negative because it calculated politically that Mr. Chavez would reach power through constant confrontation with the US.
Another development that has troubled the United States has been Chavez's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises.
The US military has had a Cooperation Office at a Venezuelan fort for 50 years.
Chavez shut it down in 2004.
5 US military trainers and students participating in the exchange program were ordered to leave the country in April 2005.
Analysts say Chavez is likely to try to indoctrinate his public and armed forces.
Analysts say Chavez's use of that force was not proven to aid the leftist revolution elsewhere.

The North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in June 2007 in the first step towards disabling it by December 2007.
On 18 June 2007 Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Christopher Hill stated that the North Korean government may prepare to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in June 2007 in the first step toward disabling it by December 2007.
Hill is the United States head negotiator on North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
Hill stated that the stalled effort to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after the weekend of 16-17 June 2007 when International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors will visit on the invitation of Pyongyang officials for talks on shut-down verification and monitoring.
Hill stated that the shut-down was a long-term anticipated outcome following talks with Chinese negotiator Wu Dawei.
Hill stated that the shutdown could take weeks but not months.
The Associated Press reported in Vienna, Austria on 18 June 2007 that the IAEA stated that the team will visit Pyongyang the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which inspectors will verify the shut-down.
Hill stated that IAEA inspectors will hold talks with Pyongyang officials on sealing the reactor including installing television monitors on the site.
North Korean officials refused to proceed with an agreement to begin decommissioning the Yongbyon reactor in 20070200 until funds worth 25 million dollars were transferred to North Korea from accounts linked to North Korea held in Macao banks.
The money freeze occurred as United States officials accused Banco Delta Asia of complicity in financial crimes against North Korea.
The funds were wired to the New York Fed Bank on June 14, 2007 months after a disagreement over the return method.
The funds are supposed to be sent to Russia's Central Bank before being transferred to a North Korean government controlled account in Russia's commercial bank.
Hill stated that the week of 17 June 2007 talks were being held between Russian, South Korean and Japanese disarmament negotiators to recoup some of the lost time in the financial transfer organization.
The discussion also involved setting a timetable for the resume of arms control talks by the six nations.
North Korean officials pledged in a 20070200 agreement to shut down Yongbyon and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a shipment of 50000 tons of fuel oil.
In the next phase of the agreement North Korean officials will declare all nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for further 950,000 tons of fuel oil.
Hill stated that the next phase of the agreement could be technically concluded by December 2007.

Leaders in arms control criticized the new nuclear activity plans released by Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency of the U.N. as ineffective and dangerous.
Iran and the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released on August 27, 2007 a plan to resolve the issue by December 2007.
The issue has not been resolved for 4 years.
The plan would mean allaying suspicions of Iran's past nuclear activities.
Agency officials stated the plan was a breakthrough.
20070828 Iranian President Mahmoud ahmadinejad stated at a news conference in Tehran --
The investigation into Iran's nuclear activities is now closed.
None of the other IAEA members cooperated as well with Iran.
Iran is a nuclear nation.
Iran has a nuclear fuel cycle.
Iran has not succumbed to international pressure to curb its nuclear projects.
Iran's nuclear project is for peaceful purposes.
The United States and some European nations believe Iran's nuclear project is to make nuclear weapons.

The Western Governments include the United States and France.
Government and experts believe Iran's attempts.
The arms control process is slowing down.
To avoid answering the question of Iran's past violations of the treaty.
Institute for Science and International Security President David Albright stated --
Iran's claims are unverifiable.
The International Atomic Energy Agency does not have access to people, documents and sites.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has lost the right to further questions in the future.
Unusual developments set a bad precedent.
The International Atomic Energy Agency may be tricked because it is eager to deal.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plan announced --
Iran resolved the question of its past plutonium experiment without explaining why.
Senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies Mark Fitzpatrick stated --
The International Atomic Energy Agency plan is superficial.
The International Atomic Energy Agency plan has drawn out negotiations for many months.
The International Atomic Energy Agency plan could leave Iran with incomplete and misleading answers.

A list from the Nuclear Suppliers Group shows that Iran has been denied the purchase of nuclear-related material since 1998 with suspicion that the purchase could be used to build a bomb.
The 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group is an offshoot of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and is in charge of monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes is not directed to military use.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group is composed of technologically advanced countries.
According to the mission statement of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, countries will act individually to block trade that violates export controls devised to maintain international cooperation in peaceful nuclear energy use.
Nuclear Suppliers Group does not have enforcement power beyond a notification to a company if they violate their guidelines.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group keeps the data private and meets largely secretly.
Most of the denials have been since 2002 and have resulted from intervened by members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
Diplomats from countries interested in exposing the extent of Iran's efforts to acquire so-called "items" which are used dual and can be converted into weapons have been availed of a list of deniability of trade.
The list would be availabe if the diplomats and their countries were not identified.
The list names companies from Australia, Finland, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and Iran which were prevented from carrying out the deal because the items being sold were suspected to be militaryly useful.
List items offered for sale in a block deal include nickel powder, petrochemical plant components, compressors, furnaces, steel flanges and fittings, electron microscopes, radiometric ore sorting machines, valves and tubing, lasers, rotary drilling rigs, mass spectrometers and nitrogen producing plants.
Iranian end-use organizations include the Iranian government and its Atomic Energy Organization, power companies, engineering companies, petrochemical companies oil refining companies, gas companies, aircraft industry, schools and universities, engine manufacturing companies, a mineral research center, helicopter support companies and a plasma physics center.
Diplomats stated that 75 denials represent only 7 of the 45 member States' actions.
Diplomats stated that the actual number of denied sales of dual use products to Iran is probably much higher than 75.
Western diplomats stated that the Iranian government uses front companies without detection to receive and convert technology into weapons production as the standoff with Iran continues over Iran's nuclear program.
Iran has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty while it is not a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

Iraqi Shiite leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani's official website was defaced and blocked in a sectarian-motivated cyber attack against sites related to Shiite Islam.
It is not clear whether the attacks began on 18 September 2008 or the morning of 19 September 2008.
Al-Sistani's website was offline on the evening of 19 September 2008.
Another website related to one of Al-Sistani's religious organizations, www.al-shia.com, was also affected.
The alternative address www.sistani.com is still in operation.
Iran's Fars news agency stated that XP blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite-related sites on 18 and 19 September 2008.
Hacking claims and Iran's assertion that XP is based in the United Arab Emirates can not be independently verified.
On 19 September 2008 several Iranian news sites stated that many of the attacked web sites related to Shiite and Iranian culture are normally run again.
The statement signed by XP was posted on the home page of Al-Sistani's web site and stated that the attack was against Sunni Muslims.
According to the statement --
XP carried out similar attacks on other Shiite sites in the Persian Gulf and Iraq.
XP erased the site as they did with other Rafidha sites.
Rafidha means reject and is an insult used by Sunni extremists to describe Shiite.

Somali pirates hijacking an Ukrainian freighter carrying large arms cargo approached the deal to release the ship.
Questions emerged regarding arms shipment through Kenya and possible clandestine arms deals with South Sudan.
On 081008 maritime officials and people associated with Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying large arms cargoes on 080925 stated that pirates could soon collect their ransom.
After a difficult negotiation likened to several people involved in bazaar-style haggling, the parties came close to reaching a deal, paying pirates millions and freeing the ship.
Ahmed Omar of Xarardheere, Somalia stated that pirates had agreed to pay approximately 8 million U.S. dollars in ransom to the ship's owners and that the ship could be freed on 8 October 2008 or 9 October 2008.
Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on Somalia's coast.
Kenyan maritime officials stated that critical details have yet to be agreed upon.
One such detail involves a pirate's request for guarantees that the armada of American warships currently encircled will not arrest or attack the pirates.
Kenyan maritime officials stated anonymously that such negotiations are complex and involve more than financial aspects.
Officials stated on October 8, 2008 progress and parties' approaches to the agreement.
The pirates initially requested 35 million U.S. dollars and then reduced it to 20 million U.S. dollars.
The pirates consistently expressed their willingness to negotiate with financial figures.
In 2008 more than 25 ships were hijacked off the Somalian coast and typically ransoms ranged from 1 to 2 million U.S. dollars.
Pirates boarding Ukrainian ships stated that the ship, its cargo and 20 sailors will be released upon receipt of payment in United States dollars and preferring a 100 dollar bill.
The question is what originally was the destination country for the arms shipment boarded a Ukrainian ship.
The Kenyan government claimed the weapons on board were shipped to the Kenyan military shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 September 2008.
The shipment will be en route to Kenya's main port of Mombasa.
33 T-72 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns, large quantities of ammunition, and weapons on board the ship.
Upon emergence emerged subsequent evidence of weapons of a clandestine arms deal between Kenya and the separatist region of southern Sudan.
The most likely outcome is that the deal remains secret unless the pirate hijacks the ship and begins speaking to the media via satellite phone.
The Ukrainian officials were adamant in denial of any wrongdoing.
Ukrainian diplomat Oleh belokolos in Kenya stated --
Ukraine has not supplied any armaments to the South Sudan Government or has no plans to do so.
All appropriate paperwork will be validated.
Ukraine abides by all United Nations rules and arms control agreements.
Ukraine inherited enormous stockpiles of weaponry after the collapse of the Soviet Union and is now a major arms dealer.
Kenya's dealing with Ukraine is considered suspicious because Kenya relies mostly on the United Kingdom and other Western countries to supply heavy weapons to Kenya.
Kenyan politicians demanded answers and called for the situation to be examined by several commissions.
South Sudan is an autonomous region whose military is currently increasing in the country and using Soviet-designed tanks.
The United States military stated that its priority is to ensure that ships are not unloaded with weapons and not sold to Islamist insurgents in Somalia.
The pirates denied their weapons interests and claimed they were unaware that tanks were part of the cargo when they hijacked the ship.
Pirate spokesman Sugule Ali stated in an interview last week that money was in the pirates' sole interest in the deal.

Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban has cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpile the raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of funding for the insurgency.
Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban has cut back on poppy cultivation and stockpile the raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of funding for the insurgency.
Costa said this to reporters last week as the U.N. Drug Office prepared to release its latest survey on Afghanistan's opium crop.
The survey showed poppy cultivation had retreated much of Afghanistan and was overwhelmingly concentrated in 7 of 34 provinces in which the insurgency remained strong, mostly in southern provinces.
The survey was issued on November 27, 2008.
The United Nations found that the result was that the amount of land dedicated to opium in Afghanistan had been reduced by 19 percent, while the total tonnage of opium produced had dropped just 6 percent.
The study stated that high output on an acreage was attributed to a good growing season in the south.
The southern region is a heavily irrigated area where the Taliban maintain a strong presence in the 5 provinces and systematic encouragement of opium cultivation to finance their insurgency for several years.
The U.N. estimates that the insurgents made much of the opium trade $300 million last year.
Costa said a lot of war effort could be funded with between 2 and 300 million dollars.
The Taliban have produced an amount of opium that has far exceeded the world demand in successive three years of bumper crops.
Costa said the result would be a glut that would depress the price drop of approximately 20 percent.
Costa said that there is evidence that the Taliban, drug lords and even some farmers stockpile opium that the price has not already collapsed.
The increased amount is also in the process in Afghanistan.
Costa added that the insurgents held significant amounts of opium.
Costa said there was as much surplus as 11000 tons, which is twice as much as the world's demand three years ago, and threatened to devalue their stockpile.
The United Nations found that Afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008.
The world demand is estimated to be about 4400 tons per year.
The Taliban took a passive stance on cultivation this year and put less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppies.
Then this will support the current price.
Costa is a six-year Italian diplomat serving in the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.

On 06 October 2001 The Citizen stated that it is illegal for South Africans to be involved in mercenary activities or to render assistance to foreign military either inside or outside South Africa.
The Citizen stated on 5 October 2001 that the South African Foreign Ministry announced that the South African Government had imposed a ban on mercenary activities following reports that 1000 military-trained Muslims had enlisted to leave Afghanistan to fight against the Taliban in the United States.
The report claimed Muslims Against Illegitimate Leaders claimed 1000 Muslim men who were military trained had volunteered for their service and received the backs of local businessmen.
The report claimed that over 18 years of military training all the men were muslims.
The Muslims Against Illegitimate Leaders is a Cape Town-based group.
The Muslim Judicial Council refuted the report.
South Africa's Foreign Ministry stated that South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act prohibits the recruitment of mercenaries or foreign military assistance from inside or outside South Africa.
South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act means that if the National Conventional Arms Control Committee grants permission people will not be allowed to offer military assistance to any state, organ or group of any other country.
South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act means that foreign military assistance can only be rendered in accordance with an agreement approved by the National Conventional Arms Control Committee.

Montesinos was sentenced to 9 years and 4 months in prison for the conviction.
Montesinos planned to appeal the sentence.
On 01 July 2002 Peru's former spy chief under the ex-President Alberto Fujimori's government Vladimiro Montesinos was convicted of illegally taking control of the National Intelligence Service when he was supposed to only advise the spy agencies.
Montesinos was sentenced to 9 years and 4 months in prison for abuse of authority.
The sentence also ordered Montesinos to pay a 3 million dollar fine as state compensation.
Anti-corruption judge Saul Pena stated that Montesinos admitted to charges of abuse of authority.
This ruling is the first of more than 50 charges against Montesinos including corruption, drug trafficking, illegal arms dealing and human rights violations.
Montesinos is alleged to have run a bribe network.
The leaked videotape shows Montesinos bribing congressman to switch parties and triggers events that culminate in Fujimori's resignation in November 2000.
Fujimori has been accused of duty dereliction and embezzlement and has been exiled under imposed in Japan since resigning in order to avoid legal action by Peruvian authorities under protection of dual nationalities.
Montesinos fled Peru in October 2000 but was captured on 23 June 2001 in Venezuela.
Montesinos heard the sentence at Callao Naval Base, where he has been imprisoned since 2001.
Montesinos stated that he would consult a defense lawyer on his appeal.

Hong Kong police are trying to prevent the Triad or transnational criminal syndicate from engaging in criminal activities.
Hong Kong police recently smashed transnational stealth syndicates specializing in exploiting youngster to commit various crimes, cross-border criminal syndicates and local Triad gangs.
The Oriental Daily News opined that the recent efforts of Hong Kong police to cut down 5 of so-called Triad branch leaders or district team leaders within a short period of up to 3 weeks demonstrated their determination to eradicate criminal activity.
Hong Kong police recently closely worked with the Guangdong Public Security Bureau for intelligence exchanges, carrying out raids and operations in the series.
Hong Kong police on 020718-020724 cracked down on Triad activities including drug trafficking, illegal arms possession, theft, burglary, robbery, sales of pirate and obscene records, duty-bound cigarettes and trafficking dangerous drugs.
Police were reported to have dispatched over 100 staff on 020724 to storm a propitiating dance and wine party organized to settle some disputes between two groups of the Triad in a disco nightclub in Mongkok, Kowloon.
The police eventually arrested 3 branch leaders and 14 core members of the Triad.
Police sources confirmed to Xinhua News Agency on 25 July 2002 that all 17 people arrested were still detained under question.
Hong Kong police sources quoted as saying that the operation has succeeded in netting all 17 people as a result of police efforts to infiltrate the relevant gangs here.
Police sources also intimated that the Hong Kong police crackdown on other gangs of the Triad will follow.
The Hong Kong police's efforts to fight off organized criminals involve active cooperation between the Hong Kong police in mainland China and the police in other regions.
Earlier in July 2002 the International Drug Enforcement Conference in the Far East was held in Hong Kong the first conference so-called targeting.
Hong Kong was chosen to host the event following the IDEC decision at a meeting held in Bolivia in February 2002.

A Peruvian military document disclosed links between Montesinos, a former head of intelligence, and drug trafficking.
A document signed by a high-ranking former Peruvian army officer was disclosed on 25 July 2002 mentioning links between drug trafficking and could further compromise the situation of former Peruvian National Intelligence Service head Vladimiro Montesinos.
According to the front page story of Peru's national newspaper El Comercio daily Montesinos may have authorized the military leader of Alto Huallaga to deal with the drug to find the leader of the rebel group Shinning Path and the leader of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
Alto Huallaga is located northeast of the capital Lima.
The story was based on the final report from the Attorney General's Office.
The Attorney General's Office report collected the accused documents handed over by an unnamed Peruvian army general.
El Comercio said the then-President Alberto Fujimori put in effect the Scorpion intelligence operation in 1992 to fight off terrorism and drug trafficking on Amazon.
Several agents infiltrated the group, including the planned Scorpion, to gather information on commanders of the main rebels and drug traffickers.
An additional order was also placed to transport the cocaine to cover up the agents.
Montesinos is a close adviser to former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.
Fujimori resigned in November over the bribery scandal and is now imprisoned in Lima over the alleged connection.

French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said on June 3, 2003 that the French government considers the crackdown on the Iranian armed opposition group the People's Mujahedeen as part of an operation against terrorism.
De Villepin said on French radio the People's Mujahedeen claimed responsibility for numerous attacks in Iran and that this dimension of terrorism cannot be hidden.
De Villepin said justice will decide the arrests and there will be no diplomatic factors in this affair.
De Villepin said the actions of the French are based strictly on justice and are determined to try and fight terrorism all the time.
French police raided the headquarters of the People's Mujahedeen in northwest Paris on 22 June 2003.
The People's Mujahedeen accused French authorities of being part of a deal with the Iranian government to carry out the operation.
The Iranian government has denied this claim.
The 17 Mujahedeen members are now under judicial investigation for allegedly linking them to terrorist organizations and funding terrorist activities.
Some 160 people were initially detained in a police crackdown on over 10 of the People's Mujahedeen's locations in France.
During the police raid, a Paris map of streets related to the US embassy was seized along with a bulletproof jacket, transmission equipment, more than 200 computers and about 90 million US dollars.
The People's Mujahedeen is classified by the United States, the European Union and Iran as a terrorist organization.
The People's Mujahedeen was formed by young Iranians college educated in the 1960s and was described as a leftist Islamist organization.
The People's Mujahedeen staged terrorist attacks inside Iran in the 1970s and killed several US military personnel and civilians working in defense projects in Teheran.
The People's Mujahedeen is part of a broad coalition initially supporting the Iranian Revolution and participating in the 1979 takeover of the US embassies in Teheran.
The People's Mujahedeen and the Government have fallen out and have built military bases in Iraq and political bases in Europe since the 1980s.
In recent years the People's Mujahedeen has claimed responsibility for assassinating several members of the Iranian regime.
These assassinations included Assodalah Ladjevardi, former director of Evin Prison in Teheran in August 1998, and Ali Sayad Chirazi, former chief commander of the Iranian army and general in April 1999.
