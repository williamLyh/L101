Support the person who started the thread resolutely. I will reply to your poem compose.
Pledge to fight to defend the Diaoyu Islands and its related islands.
The fishing boat was bumping against the fleet. The evil little ghost of Japan stirred up trouble and unrest. They showed their wolfish appearance again, with the heart of the thief and the form of arrogant form.
Never go back to that time when we embarrassed ourselves when we signed the treaty. China is strong. sharp sword shine. bury the enemy who approached.

I agree with the person who started the thread, if war really came, I would like to be Hua Mulan, to protect our homes, to defend our homeland, to spread the prestige of our China, and to pledge to fight to defend our national dignity to death.
I very much wish I had been born during Mao Zedong's passionate upsurge of that passionate Long March to lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguished all those who were wrong about China, and spread our dragon prestige.
How long do we tolerate Japan?
My fellow citizens,
Hello everyone, as we all all know, Japan had premeditated plans for another sea incident, this time Lugou Bridge, another sea incident.
Japan was surprisingly defying the condemnation of the whole world and invading the sacred territory of our country, the Diaoyu Islands.
The Diaoyu Islands, as we all know, always belong to China. For historical reasons, the Diaoyu Islands have become controversial.
My fellow citizens, our things are what we are and why negotiations need to happen. Japan is going even further, wanting to create the facts of occupation. Can we allow this? Absolutely not.
My fellow citizens, Japan's militarism has brought grave disaster to the Asian people.
China has been suffering for several decades from Japan's ravage.
JapanUnit 731 experiments with Chinese, Korean, and other living people in the Northeast with extremely brutal and cruel human body methods. Nanjing Massacre added a layer of blood to the ancient capital that never fades away. A big bloody battle in Hengyang and Changsha bare the bones of dead people over 1,000 kilometers (800 miles) and killed everything off.
According to my fellow citizens, there are too many instances of heinous crimes committed by Japan in China, which are difficult to record without exhausting all the bamboo strips.
Just like those million decease souls who lost their lives wandered over the Pacific Ocean and found it difficult to rest in peace.
When we turn to this history page and read about that era, all the people who experienced that era still remember it with vivid memories. Even our younger generation also cried tears down our cheek, and our blood was boiling in their own blood.
Japan now actually wants to reverse the verdict on its own aggression history, so as to wake up fellow citizens and Chinese people in Asia.
Although we are in pain over these past 100 years of shame, let's go face them. Let's create history and choose it, as history is not resolved.
Because we are not afraid, territorial relations between the territory and dignity matter are small. The interest and national unity of the country, regardless of how the wind and cloud changes, is guaranteed honor. We cannot let our native land be separated from its wounds.
My fellow citizens, the advent of the 21st century has meant a time of difficulty for us inside but press from the outside, and we will face many challenges.
What way should we go about the Taiwan issue, the Tibet issue, the South China Sea issue, the surrounding environment and the aggressive foreign forces of China?
What do fellow citizens, look at the world map, the crescent-shaped encirclement will suppress our breath, strangle our development, and covet our national territory.
We don't want to make enemies, but we don't want war. We don't want war.
We must urgently arrange arms and strengthen all military forces on land, sea and air.
China has been flourishing for several thousand years but has never had the ambition to expand its territory outward.
We follow the philosophy of foreign security which applies benevolence and virtue because we do not impose what we don't want on others.
The tolerance and liberalness of the country is like that of the individual, though we must insist that we don't hurt others in order to avoid hurting others.
tolerance is certainly not fear, and sincerity does not have to be cowered.
China's exemption from war repair caused by WW II served as a sign of benevolence.
My fellow citizens, the People'soes monument is a condense history of China's continuously improving nation.
The magnificent solemn posture represents a sacred expectation of peace.
Occasionally, in my mind, many heroic and tragic scenes of shining spears and armored horses spring up in my mind.
The integrity of that yellowed history page goes like I saw Kangxi alone in his audience hall hundreds of years ago, a famous generation ruler, who was also a former U.S. president who wandered alone into the great hall, thinking about the integrity of the Union, and a former U.S. president who thought about the integrity of the Union.
It is certainly dangerous to forget war, but as a fellow citizen of the world, I would say to my fellow citizens that even if we want development and peace, we must never exercise forbearance blindingly. The Boxer Pact of betraying and humiliation of the nation is a modern example of this. China is poor and backward, and falling behind is led by bullies.
What will come if not strong?
We have to focus on national defense, build up a great wall at the hearts of 1.3 billion people, establish a full range of systems capable of attacking and defending.
The best defense is that we should strengthen forces that can engage in ultra-long-range, ultra-long-range attacks and improve combat capabilities in all aerospace at great distances. increase investment and construction in defense industries, increase defense investment and construction, accelerate modernization and internationalisation of military equipment, establish high-quality, high-tech high-tech divisions, on the premise that you avoid influencing economic development of the nation.
The battle horn was about to sound, people were already fully equipped and ready to go.
We accomplished nothing without people supporting us, but we were all powerful without people supporting us.
My fellow citizens, it is time for us to say no to others. Therefore, we must achieve.
1. Establish a guarantee fund, improve work environment and work mechanisms, and recruit hundreds of professional immigrants from the United States and around the world to China.
Second, creating a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
3. Manufacturing 5000 advanced combat aircraft of various kinds.
4. Research and deployment of high-speed ICBMs with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles (22,000 kilometers) will accelerate.
5. Nuclear experiments resume and military forces established in space.
6.1000 nuclear bombs are retained, equivalent to 1 million tons of trinitrotoluene, and when necessary to install nuclear warheads for short-range and middle-range missiles.
7. Retaining 30 strategic nuclear submarines capable of inflicting devastating nuclear strikes on enemy submarines.
8. Abolish your commitment not to use nuclear weapons first.
9 Continued right to strike comes at a time of national security threat.
My fellow citizens, if we are confident and improve ourselves, we can only strive for strength. Qin Shi Huang unites China with China. Zheng Chenggong recovered Taiwan. We must carry on with our responsibilities, carrying on with the far-sight, wisdom and strength of our predecessors.
That land was shaken and shaken in its far-reaching embrace by the motherland, moaning and called upon by fellow citizens. Let's carry forward the unfulfilled wishes of previous generals, and move forward in a courageous fashion.
When I read history, the heaviness and anger in my heart was palpable. As I read history, I was concerned about the nation. However, I was willing to serve our country, volunteering to make it prosperous and once again splendid. Even if I died, I would not regret it. I was born in a cloth gown, including common people. To show my sincere patriotic heart to heaven was adequate.
I compose the poem here in the classical form of ci to voice my own aspiration.
Paint the deep red lip.
Protect Diaoyu Islands.
We bitterly lost our ryukyu Islands.
How can we allow the Diaoyu Islands to fall to other countries?
100 years of vicissitudes.
Smoke and clouds chased the flying wave.
The younger brother is still a tender youth.
wander all direction, seal born.
The flag was looked over.
We brandished our weapons and crossed the east.
Let the horses drink from the Pacific Ocean.

The other article title is a book for Taiwanese compatriots, I have dreams, the memorial museum or temple needs to be built for Chinese national heroes, how long will we tolerate it, the country will never expect it, if we forget about the hardship of history, only one country, one country, one culture, one country, one country, one country, one country, one country, and one culture can decline over the course of the sport, is the wealthy, strong people, the poor, the rich, the poor, the poor, the disgusting, the hateful housing prices of housing are going to happen if we tolerate Japan as a strong anti-bodhi anti-bodhi-moon anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodhi anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti-bodish anti
Why didn't we fight the little Japanese?
What are the Chinese still tolerant of?
They even ridden their bikes into our heads.
Still does the gut Chinese do this?
We should tell the whole world that others cannot bully China at will.
It is time to show our strength. China has been calm for too long.
The life of all our citizens is currently too carefree. Officials are too extravagant.
We already have no cohesion, China needs to start a war, harsh slap on the face of countries that follow the rear of the United States.
Let them know that the US is not pan-american. If we win, if we win, China's influence will increase. And if we lose, there will be improvements in citizen co-operation. If we lose, we can clean out incompetent bureaucrats and make trash get out. Let China have new blood and update. Let China get up.
China, go.
I'd suggest that China strengthen its guard of the Diaoyu Islands, daily guard the Diaoyu Islands, protect the fish and sovereignty of our country, and if Japan dare to invade our territory through military force, China cannot lose.
We need a show in life, but you are really p.p.
I just passed by.
This is like the whole society, including stars.
Damn, not erotic.
It is totally unacceptable.
Just cheap entertainers. Their reputation in feudal China made somewhat sense.
Their life is looking glorious.
The group is made up of 9 professions.
Life is hard.
Shocker.
That is normal, the whore is heartless and the performer is not always righteous.
They want money, not face.
Take a look at the wolf near Ms. Fan. You know, the actors have to drink with him or they won't be forced out or even framed.
son of a bitch.
as long as there is something loveliness to eat.
No one is easy to live like a show, you have to look at the scripts to know how to perform.
All somebody.
In all 360 walks, the top scorers for Imperialamination were in all 360. The effort and effort was so great behind the top scorers of Imperialamination. This humiliates the words vermicelli vermicelli.
Haha!
Overdone.
Reality.
shoot that hooligans.
The cheap performer.
The cheap performer.
The entertainment circle is dirty. All the men in it are birds, beasts and scum.
It's not easy for those star-struck female to blame, but who is to blame?
Everybody does this, how can you make money without doing it?
When a woman is proud in front of others, she is in a jubilant mood while she stays alone.
In ancient times, nowadays, nowadays, nowadays, nowadays, nowadays, nowadays, celebrities are just popular prostitutes, so it should be normal for them to drink with or even sleep with some high officials.
Stop talking with other people, just behave.
What should we do in future? The ability alone is not enough for success. Do we face such hard choices too?
More suffering disguise a glorious look, isn't it?
It's not so bad because they're just playing in their circles out of their minds.
But the old hooligans in his circle also behave like hooligans, who don't have the talent to be virtuously virtuous. He made a TV series when he had nothing to do to wreck the people of the whole country.
Both will take what they need.
How can China have a pure innocent girl?
The story is very shocking now in entertainment world. According to rumors, Hsu Yuki was forced out for refusing to drink with the company arranged and had to switch to working with a lawyer to make the meeting meet.
A star-struck, much-feared, super-person often encounter social engagement or circumstance that they are not welcome to join.
After all, they can't decide on many things, they have to have to do with many aspects and the interests of many people.
Sometimes a very normal dinner party for us ordinary people can't be that simple for the stars as we imagine.
The star has a lot of contracts and should he be well-trugued, he'd roll with the money. If she wasn't well-trugued, she'd come off her Achilles.
Those smart stars are two kinds of smart stars. Those first ones always hold very high integrity and sternly reject such an invitation.
The second kind are good at playing tricks and achieving their goals with their seed money.
There are rumors that even some super stars have won their first roles this way.
After drinking some alcohol, or adopting the most enduring attitude, advertisers or show sponsors may give their viewers the chance to lie on the star's shoulder, or feel her chin, or kiss her cheek.
They are very people from 9 lower professions.
Those stars are actually just pretending and living a much better life than this.
Just cheap entertainers. Their reputation in feudal China made somewhat sense.
Agreed.
Oh well, actors aren't easy.
They deserve it. They asked that.
Nothing dawned to me that nothing was easy.
The woman is a bird and a beast, and man is worse than birdbeast.
braawka...
braawwkkk
It didn't take long.
In late 2004, the southern border of the Richmond New Urban Region was opened to the road that runs around the southwest quadrant of the region.
It has already changed the development patterns to worsen and caused localised traffic congesting around its exit.
Today, the Richmond Times-Dispatch told the story of the impact of the HouenotTrail in Powhatan County.
Will Jones reported that traffic has more than doubled in one section of the HabernotTrail since the opening of the288.
speed and accidents surge as well.
These accidents have been reported so far this year near the intersection of Winterfield Road and Winterfield Road, up from all of 2004.
Virginia Department of Transportation Engineer Dale Totten noted that if the Virginia Department of Transportation had more money, the Virginia Department of Transportation would have 4 road lanes for about 13 million dollars.
Of course, the Department of Transportation does not have the money to construct roads in the Richmond region.
Because VOTOT spent all of their frigging money on the road, thanks to politicians and boosters locally.
Where did you need him?
This is a major moment, doh.
We predict thatRoute 28 will generate residential development in areas that are scarce and mountainous around all the exit, overtaxing local roads.
Other people choose where they work and where they live, but limited access highways can relieve traffic for people driving back and forth between Chesterfield County and Grochland County.
And they created traffic congesting in new places.
I was surprised only by this rapidity.
Even I think that maybe three or four years will be lagging.
Think about the liability that the road creates for all of its exit, because the road has already been constructed at just this one exit.
Another prediction.
The need for new road improvements is soaring in the next few years as scattered subdivisions develop and mega commercial projects intersecting major roads are approved.
Well before the end of the decade, we can see the liability that was not funded zoom well past the 4 million dollars originally taken to build the original highway.
The brainiac who thought it was such a great idea said:
Thanks for nothing.
I think we could spend more elsewhere for a better deal.
I don't think you should blame that road for creating those people.
What is the alternative if they were enough to create traffic congestion in new places?
additional traffic congesting at the old place?
Now you understand the feelings of people like TMT in Fairfax.
I usually take my position in favor of the road.
But, on the other hand, the road of rarified, with its obvious need in other parts of the state.
Richmond has virtually no traffic.
rush hour is 30 minutes.
And you give them a beltway through a largely rural area.
The road goes nowhere.
Just think that this money could be spent upgrading another Potamic crossing facility or improving the road that is desperately needed in Northern Virginia.
Virginia Centrist: The rest of the state helped pay for the288 in last year's budget deal, adding insult to injury, to wipe out the debt.
It's very nice you all have to be us.
However, it doesn't make much sense.
The problem is the same as it is.
If you get ahead of the need, you're accused of causing a sprawl.
The claim that if you build in places where the need is already acute, you can't pave your way out of congested.
Anonymous
That's a fair point.
5:26 made a good point.
But this situation hammers home the valid reporting of state auditors who found that theCTB and VOT funded transportation projects based on the best lobbyists rather than comprehensive planning for transportation to the state.
I submit that this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated.
And Chichester and his toadies poured more money into this flawed institution, making this worse.
What is the point of transportation expenses?
It was for the benefit of private businesses and not for public interest in Virginia.
You're all dead wrong.
No less Walter Stoch stated that the money for economic development was intended for the288.
Come on folks.
TMT, I don't understand your point.
What last time were you stuck in traffic for some sort of business or not?
The whole point of the road seems to be to facilitate public interest in getting and getting private businesses.
Despite the sunday driving, the grandmother's location, and of course the soccer game, businesses need overwhelming support.
No wonder we are suffering from the congestion problem, because our road expenses do not match the increase in business or state gross domestic product.
If we recognize that road benefits business primarily, we should do two things.
Of course businesses pay more for transport bills than we do for transport, but even if that means more overall travel, we are incentivised to locate them where they least stress the system.
Why is it so hard to understand?
The solution is a functioning human settlement pattern and balancing the transport system's capacity with demand for travel generated by land use.
Spin all else.
EMR
TMT said it was for the benefit of private businesses and not to serve the public interest in Virginia.
I don't see the point of this statement, as it appears to demonise private business plans and put public interest above all else.
I think they're inseparable, virtually the same.
The local problem is obvious, these cookies are lumpy.
But in aggregate, if we demonise business long enough, we will eventually find that we all work to the devil.
I don't see the claim that the solution was made that there was a balanced nature that never changed.
Even you might have seen the rail to Dulles as a positive because it promotes bidirectional rail demand.
I agree.
In fact, that may all be sufficient for the reason it was built on.
All I am saying is that the same logic should apply to the road.
They should have a destination at both ends for us to use as much as we can.
We need more places to get closer to the balance you say we need.
Reality check here.
I drove pastwatkins Landing every morning and evening.
I commute back and forth from my work to theuguenotTrail.
I have never seen anything like a flood of traffic.
It was 55 miles per hour, with 75 cars a morning.
The road to widen the HuguenotTrail is already planned due to heavy demand on the Hyde side, new schools and a whole bunch of undeveloped development that has existed in the previous years that was funneled through Robious Road.
It's a wonderful road for those of us who actually use it, rather than bottlenecking powhatan and west of Chesterfield.
We can develop economically and can work closer to our lives.
You might think that that is irrational land use.
I have no desire to live in any city.
I refused to work in the downtown area.
I refuse to use mass transit that isn't safe for female commute workers who work irregular hours.
And it happens that I like the development of a large lot.
I don't understand exactly how I was supposed to keep horses in a half acre lot.
One gallon of gas can go for $10.
And I still pay for my living in the country.
Many people genuinely prefer horse, hunt, garden and certain types of small businesses, which makes them not want to live in urban cores.
This infatuation with city life is truly baffling.
You have every right to live in a country if you wish, Anonymous 6:37.
But you're not right that the rest of the state is under-insured for the construction of a 4-billion-dollar highway to make shopping and getting work easier.
Consistent with the debates on the288, there is nothing else that could be spent that could be spent in excess of 4 million dollars.
Much of the traffic congestion is alleviated if money is applied to other press or even not road projects.
According to Ray Hyde, my comments were directed to investors who lobbied for the road to be placed near their property ownership, and an incompetent system that funded these requests regardless of whether it was linked to master transportation planning or lack thereof.
I'm 24 and my mother is 2.5 years old.
I've been with my son's father since August.
I want to start dating other people, my son's father said his son had nothing to do with her with it.
He is very possessive and controlling, but that is not his right as we are together.
It's too much going on in his life right now, he thinks we can work, but I've told him several times that I don't love him and he doesn't love me.
I want him there for his son too, he doesn't need me too.
But he has no one. His family didn't get along with him and they had issues.
I don't want to be miserable anymore and if he were around longer, I'd be more miserable.
I didn't want him there for his son because he was either a good father or at least trying to be.
I believe that every child needs both parents, whether they be together or not.
But he thinks no one can have me if he can't have me.
What do I do to move on with my life?
Very bad your ex threatened you using your son.
You have to not give in to that, it will just escalate if you give in.
You have the right to live your life and be happy, so don't cave to his threats.
Whether he really loves his son or not, this is just the typical control method people use.
Other people say things like, "If you leave me, I'll kill you, but will it get through to you?"
date.
Meet all kinds of people.
Do what you want.
If he walked out of both of your lives voluntarily, you'd probably be better off without him.
I agree, but one other thing his business is not to date or date.
I didn't tell him.
Not because he was a threat, but because he wasnt concerned about your personal life.
Can you document his threats?
You really need to.
quit taking his calls and make him leave voice mail.
Make him email or text you.
Keep that record in mind.
Get a lawyer and divorce.
Try legal aid if you can't afford one.
Tell your ex that all communication needs to go through a lawyer.
Bus drivers, tillers and food delivery people want exactly the same change.
Are they not aware that you don't get a change pile out of the bank?
Does someone have to take notes somewhere?
People get lazy.
I'd like to be as near as possible, I don't like counting copper all day.
If you take the £20 notes on the bus, they just told you to get on, you're hell lazy.
It is illegal to pay a certain amount with loads of coins, you can only pay £30 for 30 pence.
Hello, I started at uni in September but obviously didn't gel immediately as most people do.
However, I do know that it will take some time for me to adjust because I am very introvert, especially anxious and all the rest is anxiety and all.
My first night here all my housemates and I went out for the first time and it was the hardest thing I ever had to do.
When I sober up, I went to a student union bar.
But there is more to the point.
After about 5 months here I have not enjoyed the university. The course has disillusioned me, I have not enjoyed the set project, and I don't much like the course delivered.
The University is made out to be much better than it seems to be.
I started with the bad first term, the student loans were delayed adding to my stress level and I was so worried I would be unable to progress my work due to all the piled up.
My counsellor was assigned to me at uni and I saw him in a block session for about 5-6 weeks and to be honest, it really didn't work out because I never opened up to him.
Only half hearted.
My work load is now at my neck's length, I have to hit major deadlines, I am depressed and anxiety results from feeling miserable all the time.
I no longer have a counsellor, only so many times can you have one at a time, and I doubt it will help me much this time if I haven't already helped myself.
I'm lacking motivation, I don't feel comfortable with the person who lectures me, I want to give in, but I can't bring myself to give in because I end up with a job that ends in death and I aspire to someone who is someone.
I would rather die than be educated and not live the life I want to live, and to worsen the matter by dropping out of uni.
I'm 21 and will turn 22 this year, I don't have much time left to fail, something has to be done.
I've failed in college once, and I've done another course so I can get into uni. I don't want to go over the system and consistently fail.
Can someone give me some advice?
Go and see your doctor and see if you can get your deadline extended to try to ease the pressure a bit.
send your tutor an email like this post and consider the mitigating circumstances. Don't worry, they have seen all the admitted things that weren't much more uncomfortable. I know because I used to work for the University administration.
Break your work for as much as you can manage.
concentrate on one bit of work at a time, obviously the most urgent one.
Don't shut yourself off from your housemate, do well trying new things from the very beginning, keep on with it.
I recommend going see your doctor too.
If you're always an anxious person, speaking to someone might benefit you. My friend got therapy from the NHS as it was really normal because of anxiety.
I'm sure if you were being honest, your university would allow it, try and get the deadline extended.
Keep strong and carry on with life gets hard.
My mum divorced. She had a horrible time with my step dad and her new freedom sent her round the bend.
She had seizures and was manic depression with huge anger problems.
She was constantly horrible for me.
When I was home I couldn't cope with her outbursts and nasty remarks.
I'm 18 and at the point of breaking, a full time student at a highly pressured private school in the sixth form.
I can't work at home because she shouts at me.
Then I got angry with my teacher.
She was lovely one minute as I had my mummy, then turned into the most spiteful human alive.
I haven't passed my A2, and I'm already accepting that this year of my life has made me a failure.
How can I come back from this? The most amazing offer I've ever received was from the University. I couldn't even accept it. I never made a grade.
I wish I could wipe her out of my life, things would be so much better without her.
But then I think I'm just being selfish.
But this sure doesn't mean that I'm living like this, does it?
It should be so much better.
But I feel like I can't control this spiral of downhill.
And I don't know what to do.
Thanks for reading.
Nice vent.
You can't get her section for that.
Does she even have a mental illness history or diagnosis?
Sure, you don't know you won't get a good grade, but if you could, you'd accept the place.
Life throws things at you all the time.
If there is someone in your family who isn't from your family, the outsider is the outsider.
I had to deal with my dad's verbal abuse for a long time before I came to uni and honestly the only reason I'm here is because it's the only way out.
If you really want out, work hard.
It really sounds like you need support somewhere else if she can't consistently give it to you.
Can you call it Childline or something like that?
You can go to the library on Saturday and study there for a good 8 hours.
Can you go to your friend's house to form a study group?
You want her section because she's a bit of pain in the arse and you blame it on all your problems?
I know how you feel.
Hell my Mum was spit in the hell too.
I highly recommend smoking being taken up.
Ohtsr grow up and stop being a nag. It's a joke.
I thought I had become a much weaker person in between a year and two, and my personality was way down to try to make friends at uni inbetween.
But nice people are, they believe whatever hell they want to say or do about me, they are over being nice to people.
They showed absolutely no respect.
For instance, I said hello to someone from uni and they ignored me, but 30 minutes later they decided they wanted me to help them with some work and I gave them that help.
It caused alot of anger and distress in my life and really started affecting my concentration at uni.
Does anyone get any experience in handling these sorts of things or how to go about gaining some respect again?
You just said no.
If it wasn't particularly comfortable for you, you'd do it gradually.
You can start with, "I'm sorry, but I'm busy."
Of course you didn't go over the top with it, you didn't go completely the opposite direction.
If you think no, say it, mind.
They started to respect you more when they started to realize you didn't bend over backwards for them.
Of course this is really such a bad attitude, but if you're nice but just not nice enough to let them do anything to you then that's not nice, that's a fool.
I don't know if anyone has read this, but I just felt desperate and needed someone to tell.
I left home in September and started uni. I was incredibly anxious to do this but had delayed thinking about it until I got here. I'm here now and will be for over 2 weeks. I felt terribly overwhelmed by it all and felt socially awkward.
Since I moved to secondary school I have struggled emotionally for the majority of my life despite losing my dad around 9 and always blaming it on my feelings. I have had two counselling periods during my life from December 2009 to March of this year.
At the moment I am feeling things like the problems in my life are overwhelming and I make myself ever more doubting my always low self esteem. I can't concentrate on work and often find myself very quiet on social occasions. I doubt anything and everything.
My two counsellors did not diagnose me with depression and suggested I didn't suffer from depression, but I was hugely worried about depression causing my dad's death and his suicide.
I have tried to solve my problems before and found the exercise and mediation particularly useful, and have also tried things like self help books and tape. However, this is what I generally feel is my life. I have wasted one chance to exist and one chance to be a young man. This feeling is beaten away away for me.
I simply don't know what to do, and will never follow it up when I think about it. A friend often says I'm lazy and I can't disagree with him a lot of the time. I feel like people are trying everything anyone can do to help, and I fail time and time again.
I'm sorry for anyone who reads this jumble mess, I feel a bit like a moan seeking self seeking person, but I truly do feel desperate.
People's existing feelings for themselves become more intense when they are in new situations and feel pressure to socialize with strangers and fit into new roles such as student at uni.
I am not a health professional and can only speak from my personal experience, so I strongly suggest that you see a qualified health professional for things that make you feel depressed and worry about depression.
Most people feel that they are not intelligent and awkward when they get into uni, so you are definitely not alone there, but I really recommend you get an appointment for counselling services at your university. It really doesn't matter if anyone is really telling you to be depressed or not, you obviously have some problems at the minute and you can use some support for yourself. The label is not as important as your experience, but it is really helpful to really try to do anything in the minutes you are feeling like you're not motivated to do in. You feel like you're not motivated to do anything at the minute, but you will hopefully get better and you will get some help and life will be better. Not only do you feel like you're getting better but your feelings are getting worse, but you are not beaten up for not feeling motivated to do anything in the minute.
Good luck.
I think a lot more people feel the same way as you do, but they medicate themselves using friends, probably not the solution as such, but being around your friends when you're depressed is definitely better than being alone anddepressed. Either way, if you fancy a chat, feel free to express your private messages to me.
If I were you, I'd focus on the idol, someone you admire and respect, someone who comes from a bad background and ends up successful, happy, has family, marriage, etc. You don't want them, but someone you admire and respect.
You focus on what you have achieved in life. You have not stated what you have studied or why you have done it. You want experience because your Mum wants you gone, you need a degree for your career.
Either way, you sum up why you're there, and work your bottom off to get the best grades you can because when you get your degree, you'll have something you can say, hey, I didn't fail, it was hard work and I passed.

I hope this helps.
I'm pretty much not Autistic, but I thought the doctor was mispercepting me, but I walked on my toes nearly all the time.
I'm more comfortable with it.
What makes them decide that toe walking is a sign of autism because it seems random and doesn't always indicate it.
Well, I may have had something on the autism spectrum, but what one or two signs do you have?
You guys know what I mean.
Walk on toes may be an autism symptom.
The headache may be a brain tumor symptom.
Leukaemia can be a sign of a lot of tiredness.
The symptoms don't always apply, but in a lot of cases they are clear, so nothing is ever diagnosed without note.
I walked on my toes but I was born with a strange, curling, under-curling toe that had to be straightened two years ago.
My brother is Autistic but I haven't noticed either, but the spectrum is so broad and I probably have mild Asperger's, so I have communication problems and haven't picked up on social reaction/body language.
But then, I don't have the proper diagnosis, and even having some symptoms doesn't mean you may have a certain condition.
I was told not to walk on my toes for years, so I didn't walk on my toes much.
I have dyspraxia.
So you may be dyspraxic or have a short Achilles.
It is being drilled by people who do dance/g Gymnastics/Ballet etc. and I find it more comfortable now.
I haven't read too much about random symptoms like that.
Hello, I'm a 12 year old girl who is going to be 13 in two days. I'm addicted to self harm.
When I was 7, I started to slit each individual finger with a sharpie and didn't ever stop from that day.
It's getting worse because I have a scar on my leg from my boyfriend's name, so I won't stop cutting if I bleed.
I have several slit in my arms.
They were healed and I then cut the school staples and razor.
I take around 5 paracetamol and other drugs and when the cuts are not found, I take them with lager and vodka.
When I wrote this I was really tempted to cut my arms or burn them.
I'm addicted, I'll cut again when one is healed.
I think about it daily.
I'm 12 and my life is already sick.
This is a source, my dad left when I was 7 and didn't want me to know anymore.
He just cares about his new girl, his wife and his new life, which I don't want to see.
My best mate died when I was 10.
I was in a relationship with a 16 year old boy and was forbidden from speaking with him due to the event and age difference.
My Mum also suffers from Bipolar and I have depression.
I don't want to stop.
I don't care what happens to me. I want it done time and time again to torture myself. I hate it.
But I love my best mate loads, he means the world to me, if I do anything, he will do it.
I didn't tell him but he found out.
I don't want to hurt him, I don't want to hurt him.
What do I do?
Thanks for reading.
Are you on any drug or getting any therapy?
You should talk to your school nurse or GP and tell them what's going on.
Teachers that you can trust, you can tell.
If you tell people they can help you.
If you keep it bottled up inside, it will only get worse.
Trust me, this thing will get done as early as possible, not even to let it get worse.
Please don't do this.
I was 17 years old and had started self harm last year (cut my main arm off) but stopped it in a few months.
It's hard but you can do it.
I feel so much more happy than I was at the time, but seeing the scar reminds me of how I felt at that time and how strong I was for such things to happen to me.
Also, strong, you can do it. It finds salvation writing poetry and keeping journals.
Self harm is addictive, but you can overcome it.
Remember self harm does not define who you are.
You can overcome it.
In the past year I have been finding myself always checking where I belong to make sure I don't lose anything or leave anything behind every time I go out especially at uni. I thought I was getting the form of OCD.
Then, for some reason, I often have to check every two go and can't resist checking again for some reason.
Why is this?
Do I have a craze or something?
It is most often carried many things but rarely, even daily, it is still checked. Is this a disease of any extent?
What can I do about this?
If I didn't check, I'd get very anxious, sorta going away after 15-30 minutes, but there's often much anxiety that I can't wait that long.
I feel or do feel doom if I lose my wallet or phone.
I just wish I could go out in two minutes without worrying about leaving something or losing it.
I don't really know what to do and I'm afraid of going to the GP.
They probably never heard of some similar compulsion like this and I just don't know what to do.
Do any of you have similar ritual?
People think I'm crazy, but it's very strange to get yourself out of this.
What advice could you give me?
I used to do this on my way to college. I had items I knew I knew I had and used compulsive bus checking.
I'm having more severe anxiety now and I think this is a warning sign, just try to wean the habit as it's relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor but also tell yourself not to keep checking these things.
Don't worry about that, the doctors saw a much worse case.
I was doing an emoticon forOCD at a psychology class today.
The way to avoid compulsive action is just to avoid it, just check not to lose something and just leave it.
Although your anxiety levels have increased in duration, they are gradually decreasing, hopefully your OCD will disappear in overtime.
That just sounds like you're over anxious, rather than having really bad OCD.
I was very obsessed with getting up every night to check that all of my houses were locked, particularly mine.
Sometimes I'm convinced they're not locked, even though I know they are.
When obsessing really interrupted your daily routine, I think it becomes a real problem.
And don't worry, I'm sure your GP understands the issue.
I went to therapy for other reasons, and they encouraged me to pick less than 20 which I obviously checked, stick with it, and cut down.
I thought it was a good idea and would still be OK if I checked every 5 or 20 times.
I'm a lot better so far and I definitely think anyone who wants to improve will be able to improve.
I'm usually pretty calm about things, would like to take what comes as it comes, not too much worry.
But I've found myself really anxious about things over the past month or two, and I'm not talking about the mere feeling of nervousness that comes from the blue.
I was beginning to feel irrational fear of a variety of things I didn't even worry about beforehand that didn't even cross my mind as a ringing alarm bell ringing in my head.
I'm not sure if this is because of a lifestyle change (going from free care students to unemployed students) or if it was a sign of other issues, but it began to bug me because it affected my confidence and happiness.
I've spoken to a few people including my parents, but all people think I should go through the random phase and act until it was clear there was serious problems.
What is the best thing to do?
You speak to a doctor and see if the anti anxiety pills can take the edge off of things.
I saw if I could speak to a counsellor?
Or should I just take the advice of the close person around me and keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem?
Well, I should not start trying to keep an eye on your anxiety, it makes me tense and more likely to panic. There is a death circle there.
As soon as you start feeling a bit panicked about anything, try to focus on something that will make you smile or feel more happy.
Or if you can't do that, get one of your friends to make you laugh when you start feeling panic. lol It worked for me and I suffered a random panic attack lol.
I just started to really worry about things, even though you're not as severe as you are.
I find talking to someone else about what makes you anxious just helps.
Perhaps not moan, but I found myself mentioning what I was worried about to my mum and seeing her react to the situation as I should, which made me feel better about it, so I know it's not a big deal and I don't need to be anxious about it.
But if it gets worse, go to the doctor.
I have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that can prevent him from leaving the house and doing things because he is worried about what could go wrong.
The doctor gave her medication and it made her better.

The International Atomic Energy Agency reached an agreement with Iranian officials stating that there is no remaining issue and there is no ambiguity regarding Iran's nuclear program and activities.
U.S. and European officials suspect that Iran's civilian nuclear program masks efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
U.S. and European officials suspect that Iran's civilian nuclear program masks efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce atomic bombs.
U.S. and European officials can impose sanctions against Tehran as the U.N. Security Council considers the Iranian nuclear program issue for the 4th time in September 2007.
The International Atomic Energy Agency distributed limited copies of IAEA reports before the meeting of the 35 members of the IAEA board on 11 September 2007.
The finding reflects the Agency's agreement with Tehran on August 21, 2007 which was first publicized by Iranian officials and was to begin the week of 12 August 2007.
The accord said the issue and ambiguity remained regarding Iran's nuclear program and activities.
According to a Reuters news account the IAEA report said the IAEA report was a significant step forward in the work plan.
A senior U.N. official quoted by Reuters stated that the Iranian government's efforts to enrich uranium have been slow.
The IAEA report stated that Iranian officials must continue to maintain confidence in the scope and nature of Iran's present and future nuclear program.
Iranian officials stated on August 30, 2007 that the IAEA is cooperating with Iran to prevent further rounds of international sanctions.
Iranian representative to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to the Fars news agency in Tehran that the report emphasized that there was no sign or evidence indicating Iranian nuclear activities had been diverted and that all of Iran's nuclear material had been audited.
Some non-proliferation experts stated that the IAEA ceded too much to Iran.
In a critical article published in the IAEA on 19 August 2007 David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security's Washington-based arms control expert Jacqueline Shire wrote that the idea of closing files violates fundamental principles and the agreement does not specify that Iranian officials will provide the IAEA with access to key people needed to verify answers to their questions.
Experts who are not independent stated that Iran's latest agreement with the IAEA to access more nuclear sites and information was short-ended by western demands to halt the production of concentrated uranium potentially used for bombs.
U.S. State Department spokesman for the Bush administration Tom Casey stated that U.S. State Department U.S. employees have not met any international obligations regarding Iran's nuclear program but that reports may offer new details or tips for Iran's program development.
Casey stated that the Iranian regime continues to be a nuclear program that will move forward, showing that the Iranian regime is continuing to defy the international community.
Most non-proliferation experts in the west state that the 21 August 2007 agreement contained little that could dissuade policy makers in Washington, London, Paris and Berlin from moving forward with another round of Security Council sanctions.
Experts stated that many of the previously reported transparency issues that were resolved in the agreement on August 21, 2007 should be resolved.
Executive Director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association Daryl G. Kimball stated that the agreement addresses problems in the Iranian government's pursuit of enriched technology and capabilities which could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material.
Kimball stated that the Iranian government is designing to deflect criticism and pressure and claim to have made progress.
Iranian officials stated that with more sanctions there could be a reduction with inspectors.
The Security Council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on Iran despite U.S. demands and pressure from China and Russia.
SOLTANIEH stated in an interview on state-controlled Iranian television that reports and measures made any other international organization including the Security Council unjustly intervene.

proliferation; technology; international; politics
The document outlining Israel's proposal to allow international nuclear technology transfer to non-proliferation-bound States that do not sign on to non-proliferation rules was distributed to the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
The proposal may complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win Indian exemption to engage in nuclear trade.
Israeli officials convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the transfer of nuclear technology to non-proliferation-denied States.
Countries such as India, Israel and Pakistan that have not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty have been prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade including the purchase of reactors, uranium fuel or yellowcake.
The document outlining Israel's proposal was distributed to 45 members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group in March 2007.
The Israeli presentations were made without papers that allowed the official to be denied.
A letter from the chairman of the SSG said on 17 March 2007 that an Israeli presentation will be offered in the context of the 17 March 2007 debate between the SS and Indian officials over the exemption.
India is only one of the nations not to sign the treaty and has admitted to the NPS.
The Israeli plan offers 12 criteria to allow trade between non-nuclear States.
One criterion indicates Israel's status as an undeclared nuclear weapon state and said that if Israel applies the strict physical protection, control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons in its territory, all nuclear facilities in its territory, all sources and special nuclear materials in its territory, Israel should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade.
The document was circulated in Capitol Hill in September 2007 as the Bush administration was working toward an agreement with Indian officials.
Executive Director of the Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl Kimball stated that Israeli documents may affect the debate over India.
Kimball stated --
In the context of the NSL, Indian officials do not want the biggest countries in India and the United States to be obstacles.
The NPS meeting in November 2007 was difficult to reach a consensus on India.
The Israeli proposal gives some officials reasons to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
Israel's record is good, better than India's, following international nuclear rules.
The Bush administration rejected Israel's proposal despite ties between the Bush administration and the U.S. government.
The proposal may complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win Indian exemption to engage in nuclear trade.
President Bush and Foreign Secretary Condoleezza Rice viewed the pact as an important part of Bush's administration's foreign policy legacy.
The deal is controversial in India and Congress must give approval.
delaying the win of the Indian deal could negatively affect the administration's foreign policy legacy with the most negative affected being the election year.
State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that the U.S. government viewed the Indian deal as unique and did not see any precedent for any other country including Israel.
Israeli embassy spokesman David Siegel stated that the gross suggestion that Israeli government demands exemption or links the effort to any other issue including the Indian debate is inaccurate.
Seigel stated --
The Israeli government has never asked the SSG for exemption for nuclear supply guidelines or specifically for Israel.
Israel is recognized as a full-fledged follower of the SSG guidelines.
The Israeli government urged the NPS to consider adopting a generic approach to nuclear technology transfer based on criteria and at multiple tiers.
Some NSL officials have previously suggested an approach similar to that of Israel.
The Nothern non-proliferation regime will be enhanced greatly if the Nothern non-proliferation regime is modified with lines proposed by Israeli officials.

Ahmadinejad announced that Iran's uranium production capability will expand.
Iran has refused to commit to halt the expansion but has hinted that future expansion could be halted.
Iranian President Mahmoud ahmadinejad stated on 26 July 2008 that Iran has expanded its uranium enrichment-producing centrifuge arsenal to over 5000 scholars in the northeastern city of Mashbad.
Ahmadinejad has stated that the expansion is the first since the announcement in April 2008 that Iran is approaching implementation of 6000 centrifuges.
Iran has articulate a goal of 50,000 centrifuges to be operational at an enrichment plant near Natanz.
The international community demands that Iran halt production of nuclear material.
The number of centrifuges cited by Ahmadinejad is different from that of the media.
Iranian news agency reported that Ahmadinejad had stated that Iran had 6000 working centrifuges but the statement was subsequently removed from the Internet.
Another Iranian news agency stated that Ahmadinejad referred to 100000 centrifuges.
Experts have discounted the significance of Ahmadinejad's claims because the information about the centrifuge's capabilities was absent.
A Western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity stated that the number of centrifuges is less important than the operation and efficiency of machines but Ahmadinejad's assertion that the resolution of the diplomatic standoff between Iran and the West is hindered by the number of centrifuges.
New America Foundation arms control expert and New America Foundation expert Jeffrey G. Lewis stated that the New America Foundation has realized Iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but does not know the operation status of the machines.
Diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems hindered Iran's enrichment program.
Iran has repeatedly repeated its assertion that its nuclear program is aimed only at producing electricity because producing nuclear weapons contradicting Islamic principles.
The majority of western arms control experts believe that Iran is pursuing the ability to produce a bomb immediately upon the decision.
Experts stated that weapons-grade uranium is relatively simple to produce from reactor-grade material.
Ahmadinejad stated the West is still pursuing negotiations to resume after Iran's resistance to demands to halt its nuclear activities.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana recently presented 2 offers to Iran.
The package of incentives for uranium enrichment production to cease is endorsed by the US.
The pre-negotiate period in which Iran did not add centrifuges and the west refrained from promoting the 4th round of economic sanctions against Iran to the UN Security Council.
US officials have repeatedly stated that negotiations could not begin before Iran halted all its alleged enrichment-related activities which could be verified but that the Bush administration has recently agreed on a frozen freeze for the proposed freeze and has dispatched to Geneva.
On 26 July 2008 Iran refused to respond to Solana's offer during talks in Geneva attended by US Undersecretary of State William J. burns.
The talks constitute the highest level diplomatic contact between the US and Iran in nearly 30 years.
Solana, Burnes and European envoy set a deadline for Iran to respond positively before starting new sanctions including the prohibition of the sale of refined petroleum products vital to Iran's economy.
Iranian officials refused to commit to stop the expansion or observe the deadline.
On 26 July 2008 Ahmadinejad appears to suggest that Iran could potentially halt the expansion in over 6 weeks with a higher number of centrifuges than previously expected.
Ahmadinejad stated that if the number of centrifuges in operation does not increase the West will consent to between 5,000 and 6000 existing centrifuges.
The 5500 centrifuges could produce nuclear materials sufficient for power plants or atomic bombs if highly enriched.
6000 centrifuges that continue to be run could produce weapons-grade uranium in 6 months.
The International Atomic Energy Agency stated in May 2008 that Iran possesses 3500 centrifuges in operation.

The Paris diplomacy meeting concluded that further steps were not being taken to halt Iran's uranium enrichment at the Natanz facility.
Diplomats stated at a Paris meeting on 14 November 2008 that officials from the United States, Europe, Russia and China have not further reached an agreement to act to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment at its Natanz facility.
Uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that could produce fuel for nuclear power plants and could produce fissile material for atomic weapons.
The meeting of 13 November 2008 ended with no new measures announced.
After the 13 November 2008 meeting the Foreign Ministry of France released a statement declaring that the international community reaffirms the dual track approach to diplomatic engagement and work towards sanctions.
Russia and China have resisted new sanctions against Iran.
Russia and China are close political and business ties and do not feel domestic pressure to act against Iran.
The United States has close political and business ties with Iran and feels domestic pressure to act against the country.
Russia and China hold veto power over Security Council decision.
Russian diplomat Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by the Interfax news agency in Moscow as stating that the parties had not struck a deal to deal with Iran at a meeting on November 13, 2008 but that western countries did not support the deal.
Sergei Ryabkov attended the meeting on November 13, 2008.
The report released this week said that significant progress had been made in the research facility near Arak.
The research reactor near the Arak city could eventually produce plutonium which could be used for nuclear weapons.
The satellite images published by the Institute for Science and International Security show significant progress in the construction of the research reactor facility near Arak from February 2008 to October 2008.
David Albright stated that heavy-water research reactor near the Iranian city of Arak had evaded notice from the international security community.
David Albright stated that satellite images have indicated significant progress in Iran's heavy water research reactor near Arak and that the large-scale construction of the research reactor will be completed in 1.5 years.
David Albright is the former director of arms at the Institute for Science and International Security based in Washington D.C.
Iran has stated it will pursue nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research.
The United States and its western allies suspect that Iran's production has preceded its own efforts to create nuclear weapons infrastructure.
The production of low grade uranium is legal under international arms control regulations.
The latest development of nuclear technology by Iran shows a complex technical challenge facing President-elect Barack Obama's incoming foreign policy team to take on the task of stopping Iran from mastering technology that could be used to manufacture and deliver nuclear weapons.
The United States President George W. Bush administration managed to synchronize American policy with leaders from the European Union, Britain, France and Germany in the last month of power in order to press for tougher sanctions and diplomatic action.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is expected to release a report criticizing Iran next week.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency.
The new Iranian nuclear program initiative that emerged in Paris on November 13, 2008 has decreased hopes that another set of United Nations Security Council sanctions will be imposed before the end of President Bush's term.
Iran will continue to work toward mastering nuclear and missile technology as part of diplomatic maneuvering.
Some Israeli officials stated that this week Iran test-fired a two-stage solid-fuel rocket with a range of 1200 miles.
Tel Aviv is less than a half a mile from Iranian territory.

A high-security Russian laboratory complex stored anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria faces electricity losses due to lack of payment with Mosenergo.
A large underground repository of deadly anthrax, plague and other deadly bacteria stored in a high-security Russian laboratory complex 100 miles south of Moscow threatens to lose electricity.
Mosenergo utility officials in the Moscow region have recently arrived in Russia's laboratory complex and threaten to turn off electricity due to lack of pay.
In the Soviet era, the Russian laboratory complex was a 90 - building campus and served as a location for secret biological weapons programs.

General Nikolai N. Urakov likes for the United States and western countries who contribute about 6 million dollars each year to the transformation of the former bioweapon complex to another 500,000 dollars each year to pay for the State Scientific Center of Agricultural Microbiology's electric bills and arrears.
A US scientist who works at the State Scientific Center oflied Microbiology stated that the Russian government is responsible for paying its electric bills.
In 1997, Western aid to one of General Nikolai N. Urakov's bioweapon laboratories was peaking as the West learned that Iran had offered to purchase the expert from the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
Russian scientists and military leaders who are now dependent on western financial support to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are known to orchestrate the sense of crisis to increase finance.
American scientists named Randall LeeBeatty worked to convert the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
Beatty stated that this threat of electricity cuts at the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology is a crisis.
Randall LeeBeatty is the International Science and Technology Center's director.
The International Science and Technology Center is financing approximately half of the International Science and Technology Center's budget which supports about 350 Russian biowarfare scientists and technicians.
Randall LeeBeatty stated that it is known that the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology has not paid its electricity bills for 14 months.
Randall LeeBeatty stated that the State Scientific Center of Agricultural Microbiology is one of the most important places to archive dangerous pathogen and that destroying the State Center of Agricultural Microbiology is shameful because it is not paying electricity utility.

Raymond Zilinskas stated that in worst cases the bacteria are defrosted in the worst case and the clean-up afterward is really a mess as to not know if all the bacteria are dead.
Another example is that Mosenergo's electricity utility confronted the State Scientific Center of applied Microbiology in Obolensk with the dangerous possibility that the basic economic imperative for enterprises to sustain themselves could clash with the old Soviet science remaining from Soviet-weapon science.
The overdue power bill in 2000 caused Russia's National Power Company to cut off electricity at a strategic base where nuclear missiles stand on high alert.
The nuclear missile silo does not lose power.
Armed troops marched to the substation and turned the power back on.
A number of military installations around Russia were cut in January 2001 by the nation's United energy system (UES).
Kamchatka is the site of a military installation that lost power.
Most military installations that have been cut off from electricity are quickly restored.
The investigation shows that warring utilities and military often force them to spend their funds on electricity rather than diverting it to other uses.
Some of the funds cut at times have been built for generals in the country.

Brazil implemented a law allowing the Air Force to target drug traffickers in Brazilian airspace.
The US is concerned about the misidentification of civilian planes.
Brazil announced that the Brazilian Air Force had begun to shoot down aircraft used to traffic illegal drugs in Brazilian airspace.
The plan required eight precautionary steps before orders could be issued for the planes to shoot down.
The publicity campaign notified ranch owners and others that they needed to file a flight plan prior to the policy taking effect in late October 2004.
The original law permitting such action was approved in 1998 but President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of 1995-2003 never put the policy into effect.
The United States dissuaded Cardoso from signing the decree because the US feared that downing civilian aircraft could expose the US government and companies to lawsuits.
In April 2001 the United States reduced previous support for anti-drug operations targeting small planes misidentifying as drug carriers when a Peruan jet shot down a small plane misidentifying as drug carriers and killed a Peruan missionary and her children.
The victim's relatives sued the US government and won the settlement because the US provided intelligence and technical support for the operation.
A US State Department official stated that --
A certain condition may be that US law may forbid assistance from countries that implement the shot-down law.
The US agreed with Brazil to assess the very serious and increasing threat posed by drug traffickers.
The US government is consulting with the Brazilian government on the Brazilian law.
Brazilian Defense Minister Jose Viegas stated that Brazil encountered difficulties in securing support for the plan from the US but that recent bilateral talks lead to the certainty that the Brazilian government will accept the decree without exposing Brazil to commercial sanctions.
Brazilian officials expressed hopes that the US will endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
The US is scheduled to provide 10 million US dollars of drug aid and law enforcement aid to Brazil in 2004.
Former Air Force Chief of Staff and Director General of the Air Institute at Estacio de Sa University in Rio de Janeiro Mauricio de Gandra stated that the Brazilian government has taken courageous measures but that the impact is more practical because of the restrictions imposed on it by the Brazilian government.
Brazilian officials stated that the policy may not apply against aircraft boarded by children.
Viegas stated that there needs to be limits.
Gandra stated that the provision undermines the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug smugglers carrying children and introducing the possibility that kidnapped children could be used as human shields.
Viegas stated in an interview in Brailia that the government had previously used the law to dissuade drug traffickers entering Brazilian airspace with the feeling that the Air Force was not under threat from them.
The Government was prompted by the deteriorating public security situation of an increasingly powerful drug gang in Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro.
The drug gang in Rio de Janeiro has more firepower than the police and has successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close.
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva made the statement in an interview with foreign correspondent in 2003.
The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security.
Some drug-runner aircraft pilots felt so confident in retribution that they made obscene gesture at the pursuing Brazilian Air Force pilot.
The law is a question of legality under Brazilian law which prohibits the death penalty for criminal acts.
Some legal experts and other commentators have stated that the de-facto amount of executions of drug traffickers is contrary to what the government claims.
The daily O Estado de Sao Paolo stated in an editorial the week of 18 July 2004 that extreme measures raised ethical and juridical problems that exceed any potential benefits.
The administrative decision of the Air Force commander applies extrajudicial penalties.
These people gained life-power over crew members and non-stop passengers.
Brazil inaugurated a 14-billion-dollar SIVAM radar system in 2002 that will allow the government to monitor air activity throughout the expansed Amazon region.
The system uses American technology.
Illegal flying has declined by 30 percent initially over concerns about improved trackability for traffickers but has subsequently recelerated.
Brazil had recorded 4128 unauthorised flights in 2003.
Some of these flights are some of the most innocent violations of farmers flying between the plantation and the Amazon.
Viegas stated that the deliberate violations of Brazilian airspace by drug smugglers who apparently are unaware that the government cannot retaliate have increased significantly.
Drug dealer Rio de Janeiro's most notorious drug dealer was captured in Colombia in April 2001 in a drug-shot pipeline involving leftist guerrillas.
The northern Amazonian corridor has become an increasingly busy route for global drug trade and is being used to smuggle arms, gold and diamond.
Among the most important routes for supplying cocaine to Europe are smuggling drug and gun smuggling from Colombia to Suriname and across the northern tier of the Amazon.
Colombia is the only country currently with policies to target drug traffickers.
Colombia is the source of much of the cocaine and heroin sold in the United States.

International; weapons; leader; military
Venezuelan President Vladimir Putin's weapons deals with Russia, curbs military cooperation with the United States and plans to train as many as 200,000 Venezuelan civilians to repel possible superpower invasion.
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's weapons deals with Russia, curb military cooperation between the US and Russia and plan to train as many as 200,000 civilians to repel imperialist invasion.
Chavez insisted that the move was purely defensive and that the need to update obsolete military hardware and protect Venezuela from nations who might want to control Venezuela was overdue.
Venezuela is the world's top petroleum producer.
Chavez's domestic critics have been flocking to the idea that the US would ever invade Venezuela and have charged that Chavez was really intent on arming a huge cadre of loyal reservists who protected him from any internal uprising and posed a militarized counterweight to his influence in Latin America.
Cuba's leader Fidel Castro was a major ally of Chavez and grew closer with Chavez.
Chavez's detractor in the US government said that the US government's strategy to restructure Venezuelan democracy in the militarized, Cuban-style image that foment the left revolution throughout South America was even more troubling.
The US military strategists said they are increasingly concerned that such a radical move inspired by Chavez could foment such a revolution.
The political mainstream in Latin America has been shifting leftward since the late 1990s.
This shift towards leftward shift is largely a reaction to perceived failures in free market economics.
The left was elected leader of Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela.
People who supported Chavez at home counter that the United States has a long history of openly intervening and covertly intervening in Latin American domestic politics for a century and a half, saying that Venezuela has no right to question its defense preparation.
Carlosro Espinoza Leon said that the Venezuelan people never asked the US marines what they would do.
Chavez's favorite Espinoza Leon is the service coordinator for Venezuela's National Assembly for Defense.
Espinoza said that Peru has 500,000 rifles and no one has said anything.
Espinoza said no one is complaining about Colombia being the most militarized country in Latin America.
Espinoza said that US history was full of aggression in Latin America.
Espinoza said that the Venezuelan people must do whatever necessary to protect Venezuela.
Chavez was famous for saying that the so-called Bolivarian Revolution was peaceful but not armed.
Chavez was first elected in 1998 and according to an independent poll conducted by Datanalisis he had 71 percent of his popularity.
Venezuelan military analyst Alberto Carrido said in Russia, China and Iran that Chavez was looking for allies to promote a multi-polar world that would counter US dominance and encourage grass-roots movement in Latin America to throw the Venezuelan government's influence into doubt.
orenzo Campos is a farmer from the northern Venezuelan state of Anzoategui and was trained as a reservist.
Campos said that the world wants to know that the Venezuelan people are not prepared to attack anyone and that the country is protected on mission.
Chavez's government announced in May 2005 details of a $18.6 million arms purchase deal with Russian firms to purchase 100,000 AK-103 rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition and technology transfer to Venezuela to manufacture them.
The deal worked out for 186.22 dollars for one rifle.
This price is considerably less than the equivalent price of 835 dollars for the same weapons ordered by US mail.
The Venezuelan government also intends to buy 10 Russian helicopters, 10 transport planes from Spain and six naval craft from Venezuela.
Venezuelan officials said the government is negotiating with Brazil to buy around 24 air support planes and training planes.
Chavez insisted and even the most staunch military critics here agreed that the purchase was essential to update old military weaponry such as the FAL's decades-old FAL.
Retired General Fernando Ochoa Antonich said that it was exaggerated to say Chavez was engaged in the build-up of arms.
Ochoa was the defense minister in 1992 when then-Lieutenant Colonel Chavez launched a failed coup.
Ochoa stated that Venezuela had not bought arms in 25 years and said Chavez had not aggressively bought weapons from his neighbors.
Ochoa said that Venezuela has never bought Russian arms before and suggested Chavez buy Russian arms to become independent of the US.
choa asked why Chavez bought rifles popular with subvertist forces in Latin America and stated that Chavez's political support of radical left moves made him a continent menace.
The US government openly questioned what Chavez had done with the old FAL and whether he had shared weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in Latin America.
The US government did not provide any evidence that Chavez was arming or funding leftist insurgency.
Colombian military analysts and military specialists who specialize in guerrilla guerrillas say rebels have plenty of weapons from drug trafficking and have no interest in old rifles from Belgium or Chavez's assistance.
A study published in the US Defense Intelligence Agency in 2003 reported that more than half of the weapons seized from Colombian guerrillas from 1998-2001 were traced to Venezuela.
The implication is that corrupt or sympathetic members of the Venezuelan military could aid guerrillas.
Critics say Chavez's domestic critics are more troubled by the ideological trainings of military and civilian reservists, according to Chávez's critics.
Chavez called for a revolution unit to start in early 050000 to prepare the public to resist superpower aggressors and said that the first step in the coming year would be to train between 100,000 and 200,000 active duty volunteers to back up armed forces.
Military analysts estimate that Venezuela's armed forces are 83,000 active duty forces.
The people's defense units were created in neighborhoods, state companies and the free University established under Chavez and reported directly to the President.
The government insists that the reserve supports armed forces and does not act against the possible coup against Chavez.
Espinoza said that if there was a civil war, reserve should not be used for troops that shocked any political party and that each person would decide his side.
General Julio Ramon Quintero Viloria was the reserve commander.
Quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50,000 civilians over the 20 weekend of 050000 and that in 2006 they could train 300,000 more civilians.
Quintero said that the people of Venezuela do not want any colony of any empire and that they must be ready as soon as possible.
In June 2005, 100,000 reservists and the Venezuelan navy engaged in a massive war game to repel an invading country.
In June 2005, 40 state employees with 1200 soldiers participated in similar exercises.
The circle of Chavez's supporters here warned of asymmetric warfare.
The asymmetric warfare is a term coined by US military strategists that describes an unequal conflict between equal combatants and weaker side employing guerrilla tactics.
The US government has given the most military aid to Colombia in the past 5 years.
Chavez loyalists fear that the US government could instigate a proxy war between the US and Venezuela to oust Chavez and control Venezuelan oil.
A senior US official dismissed the notion that the US government wants to invade Venezuela as utter nonsense in an interview.
The official said that the Chavez side wishes to make negative relations because they calculate that Mr. Chavez has always reached power through constant confrontation with the US.
Another development that troubles the United States was Chavez's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises.
The US military has had the Cooperation Office in the Venezuelan fort for 50 years.
Chavez shut it down in 2004.
The 5 US military trainees participating in exchange programs and students were ordered to leave the country in April 2005.
Analysts say Chavez was likely trying to indoctrinate his public and armed forces.
Analysts said that Chavez's use of that force was not proof that he was aiding the leftist revolution elsewhere.

The North Korean government may be prepared to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step to disable it by December 2007.
On 18 June 2007 Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Christopher Hill stated that the North Korean government was prepared to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in June 2007 as the first step to disable the plutonium-producing reactor by December 2007.
Hill is the head of North Korea's nuclear weapons program and a US-North Korea negotiator.
Hill stated that efforts to dismantle North Korea's stalled nuclear weapons program could move ahead ahead after the weekend of 16 June 2007 and 17 June 2007 when inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are to make talks with Pyongyang officials to verify and monitor the shut-down.
Hill stated that the long-delayed shut-down was followed by talks with Chinese negotiator Wu Dawei.
Hill stated that the shut-down could happen in weeks but could not happen in months.
The Associated Press reported on 18 June 2007 that the IAEA stated that a team will visit Pyongyang the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which inspectors will verify the shut-down.
Hill stated that IAEA inspectors held talks with Pyongyang officials about the reactor's seals including installation of a television monitor at the site.
North Korean officials refused to proceed with an agreement to begin decommissioning the Yongbyon reactor in 070200 until funds worth 25 million dollars transferred to North Korean-linked accounts held in Macao banks were transferred to North Korea.
The money was frozen when US officials accused Banco Delta Asia of complicity in financial crime in North Korea.
The funds were wired to the New York Federal Reserve Bank on 14 June 2007 after months of disagreement over the method to return them.
The funds are supposed to be sent to Russia's Central Bank before being transferred to a North Korean-controlled account in a North Korean commercial bank.
Hill stated that the week of 17 June 2007 there will be talks among Russian disarmament negotiators, South Korean disarmament negotiators and Japanese disarmament negotiators to recoup some of the time lost in the organized financial transfer.
The discussion also involved setting a timeline to resume arms control talks between the six nations.
North Korean officials pledged to shut down the Yongbyon reactor and allow inspectors to verify and monitor the reactor in return for shipments of 50,000 tons of fuel oil under an agreement reached in February 2007.
The next phase of the agreement will be when North Korean officials declare all nuclear programs are in place and disable all facilities in return for further 500,000 tons of fuel oil.
Hill stated that the next phase of the agreement could be concluded by December 2007.

Somilian pirates hijacking Ukrainian freighters carrying a large arms cargo approached a deal to release the ship.
The question emerged regarding arms shipments through the Kenya-Sudan smuggling route and possible clandestine arms deals with South Sudan.
A maritime official and an associate of a Somalian pirate who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large arms cargo on October 25, 2008 stated on October 8, 2008 that the pirates may soon collect their ransom.
The parties came close to a deal that would pay pirates millions and free ships after a difficult negotiation involving several people who were involved in the bazaar-style haggle.
Ahmed Omar of Xarardheere city in Somalia stated pirates had agreed to ransom approximately 8 million U.S. dollars from ship owners and could be freed on October 8 or 9, 2008.
arardheere is a notorious pirate base located on Somalia's coast.
A maritime official in Kenya stated that critical details have yet to be agreed on.
One such detail involves pirates requesting guarantees that the current armedada of United States warships would not arrest or attack the pirates.
An anonymous Kenyan maritime official stated that such negotiations are complex and involve more than financial aspects.
The official stated on October 8, 2008 that progress had been made and the parties had approached the agreement.
The pirates initially requested 35 million U.S. dollars and then reduced the request to 2 million U.S. dollars.
The pirates consistently expressed their willingness to negotiate with financial figures.
More than 25 ships hijacked in 2008 off the Somalia coast, typically for between 1 and 2 million U.S. dollars each.
The pirates on board the ship stated that the ship would be released along with its cargo and 20 sailors who would receive United States dollars and a 100 dollar bill.
The question is the original destination country for the arms shipment that was bound for Ukraine.
The Kenyan government claims the weapons on board were shipped to Kenya's military shortly after the freighter was hijacked on 25 September 2008.
The ship was bound for the main Kenyan port of Mombasa.
The weapons on board the ship include 33 tanks, 150 grenade launchers, 6 anti-aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition.
The subsequent evidence emerged that the weapons were part of a clandestine arms deal between Kenya and the southern Sudan's separatist region.
The deal is most likely to remain secret if pirates do not hijack ships and begin speaking to the media via satellite phone.
The Ukrainian officials were adamant in denying any wrongdoing.
Oleh Belokolos of Ukraine's diplomat office stated that --
Ukraine does not supply any arms to the South Sudan government or have any plan to supply the South Sudan government.
All the appropriate paperwork has been validated.
Ukraine is in compliance with all United Nations rules and arms control agreements.
Ukraine inherited enormous weaponry stockpiled after the Soviet collapse and is now in a major arms deal.
The deal between Kenya and Ukraine is considered suspicious because Kenya relies mostly on the United Kingdom and other western countries for heavy weapons supplies.
Kenyan politicians demanded answers and called for several investigations into the situation.
South Sudan is an autonomous region that has increased its current military capability using Soviet-designed tanks.
The United States military stated that it will prioritize making sure the ship does not unload weapons and is not sold to Islamic insurgents in Somalia.
The pirates denied their weapons interest and claimed they didn't realize the cargo was being held by tankers hijacking ships.
Spokesman for the piratesugule Ali stated in an interview last week that the pirates were solely interested in the deal.

Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said that Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban cut back poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve major sources of insurgency financing.
Head of the U.N. Drug Office Antonio Maria Costa said that Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban cut back poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve major sources of insurgency financing.
Costa said this to reporters last week as the U.N. Drug Office prepares to release its latest opium crop survey of Afghanistan.
The survey shows that poppy cultivation has been largely retaken in Afghanistan and concentrated in 34 provinces, mostly southern provinces.
The survey was issued on November 27, 2008.
The United Nations found that the reduction of land devoted to opium in Afghanistan has resulted in a 19 percent reduction in opium production, while total opium production has dropped to just 6 percent.
The study stated that high annual output is attributed to good southern growth seasons.
The southern region is a heavily arated area where the Taliban maintain a strong presence in the 5 provinces and systematically encourage opium cultivation to finance their insurgency for several years.
The U.N. estimated that the insurgents made much of the opium trade last year.
Costa said that a lot of the war effort could be funded with between 2 and 3 billion dollars.
The Taliban produce far exceed the demand of the world in successive bumper crop years.
Costa said the result was a glut that depressed prices which dropped by approximately 20 percent.
Costa said that there is no evidence that the price has already collapsed due to Taliban, drug lords and even farmers stockpiling opium.
The increased amount is also in process in Afghanistan.
Costa added that the insurgents held a significant amount of opium.
Costa said there was as much as 11,000 tons surplus, which is more than twice the demand of the world over the last three years, and threatened to devalue their stockpile.
The United Nations found that Afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008.
The world demand is estimated to be about 4500 tons a year.
The Taliban are taking a passive stance towards cultivation this year and are pressuring Afghan farmers to plant opium poppy.
Then this supports the current price.

The Citizen newspaper stated on 6 October 2001 that it is illegal for South Africans to be involved in mercenary activities or to render assistance to the foreign military inside or outside South Africa.
The Citizen stated on October 5, 2001 that the South African Foreign Ministry announced that the South African government has imposed a ban on mercenary activities following reports on October 5, 2001 that 1,000 Muslim military trainers had enlisted to leave Afghanistan to fight the United States for the Taliban.
The report claims that 1000 Muslim trained military trainers volunteer their service and receive the backing of local businessmen.
The report claims there were 1,000 Muslim men trained in military training over 18 years.
The Muslims against illegality is a group based in Cape Town.
The report was refuted by the Muslim Council.
South Africa's Foreign Ministry stated that South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act prohibits the recruitment of mercenaries inside or outside South Africa for foreign military assistance.
South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act means that people are not allowed to offer military assistance to any state, organ or group or other country unless the National Conventional Arms Control Committee grants permission.
South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act means that foreign military assistance may only be rendered in accordance with an agreement approved by the National Conventional Arms Control Committee.
