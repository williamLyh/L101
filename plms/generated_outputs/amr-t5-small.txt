Support the thread starter resolutely. I replied with a poem.
pledge to fight your death to defend the Diaoyu and its related islands.
The fishing boat was bumped into the fleet. The evil little Japanese ghost stirred up trouble and unrest. They again showed their wolfish appearance with the thief's hearts and arrogance forms.
Never go back to that time when we appear humiliating when we sign the treaty. Strong China. Sharpen the sword and shine the knife. We bury the approaching enemy.
September 11, 2010
I agree with the thread starter analysis. If the war really comes, I would like to be Hua Mulan to protect our homes, to defend our homeland, to spread the prestige of our China and to pledge to fight the death of our national dignity. Resolute bump up.
I very much wish to be born in that passionate and upsurge Long March of Mao Zedong to lose my head, shed my blood, completely extinguish all the wrong minded enemies of China and spread our dragon prestige.
How would we tolerate Japan?
My fellow Citizens.
Hello everyone, now that we all know about the 18th September, Japan has a premeditious plan for another sea incident like the Lugou Bridge.
Japan surprisingly defied a strong condemnation from the whole world and openedly invaded our country's sacred territory, the Diaoyu Islands.
As we all know the Diaoyu Islands always belong to China. For historical reasons, what originally belongs to us has become a controversy.
My fellow Citizens, what is ours, and why is the need for negotiations? So Japan is going even further (I want to create a fact of occupation). Can we allow this? Absolutely not.
My fellow Citizen, Japan's militarism brings grave disasters to the Asians.
Especially China has suffered several decades of Japanese ravaging.
The Japanese military unit 731 has cruelly experimented with Chinese, Korean and other Japanese living people with extreme brutal methods in the Northeast. The Nanjing Massacre has added a bloody layer of blood that has never faded away from the ancient capital. The bloody battles in Hengyang and Changsha bared the bones of the dead over 1000 kilometers and killed everything off.
[/QUOTE] My fellow Citizens, there are too many instances of the heinous crimes committed by Japan in China, which are hard to record without all the exhaustion of the bamboo strips.
Just like those 10 million deceased souls who lost their lives wandered over the Pacific Ocean and found it difficult to rest in peace.
So all those who had experienced that era still remember it vividly. Even our younger generation had also cried the tears that were streamed down our cheeks, and our blood boiled indignation whenever we turned to this historical page and read it.
Now that Japan actually wants to reverse the verdict on its aggression history, it wakes up to fellow citizens and Chinese asians.
We have to go face it despite the pain of looking back at this shameful 100 years. Without a resolution to the history issue, let's create and choose history.
We are afraid, because we are not afraid. Although the territory is small, it is related to a matter of dignity. No matter how much the wind and cloud changes, the interests of the country and the national unity guarantee honor. We cannot let our native land separate, even though it is wound.
My fellow Citizen, the advent of the 21st Century means a time for the difficult to beset inside rather than press us out, and we face many challenges.
What way should we go about the Taiwan/Tibet/South China Sea issue, the surrounding environment, aggressive foreign forces to China?
What do I say to fellow citizens? Please look at the world map and the crescent-shaped encircles suppress our breathing, strangle our development and covet our national territory.
We don't want to make enemies, but we don't want wars, but we don't want them.
We must urgently arrange arms and strengthen all military forces on land, sea and air.
The Chinese nation has been flourishing several thousand years, but has never had the ambition of expanding its territory outward.
We follow a foreign security strategy philosophy that applies to benevolence and virtue because we don't impose on other people what we don't want.
Tolerance and liberalness of the country is like the individual's, we have to insist on not being hurt, but to avoid hurting others.
Tolerance is certainly not fearful and sincerity must not be cowardice.
Exempt from China from Japan from war repairs due to WW II serves as a source of benevolent peace.
My fellow Citizen, the People's Heroes Monument is a condensing history of a Chinese nation striving to continually improve.
The magnificent solemn posture represents a sacred expectation of peace.
In my mind, many heroic, tragic scenes of shine spears and armored horses have occasionally agitated my memory string of thoughts.
Like I saw Kangxi alone in his audience hall hundreds of years ago contemplating how to achieve a territorial unification, and also Abraham Lincoln alone in wandering the dark of the great hall and thinking of Union's integrity as a former U.S. president, he went through that yellow page of history.
Peace is peaceful in the world, although wars are certainly dangerous to forget. My fellow Citizens, if we want development and peace, we must never exercise forbearance blindly. In modern times, the Boxer Protocol of traitors and humiliation of a nation aggravates China's poverty and backwards. The fall behind leads to bullies.
What will peace come without a strong?
We must focus on national defense education, build up a great wall in the heart of 1.3 billion people and establish a full range of national defense systems capable of attacking and defending.
The best attack defenses are: we should strengthen forces that can engage in ultra long-range attacks, improve combat capabilities in all aerospace from a great distance and deep. Increase investment and construction in the defense industry, accelerate military and internationalization, establish an elite high-tech division of high quality, and avoid the influence of economic development of a nation.
The battle horn sounds about to sound, people are already fully equipped and ready to go.
We accomplish nothing without the support of the people, but we are all powerful by the support of the people.
It's time to say no to other citizens of mine, so we have to achieve.
1. Establish guarantee funds; improve work environment and work mechanisms; recruit hundreds of thousands of professionals who emigrated from the United States and around the world back to China and have lingered on information technology.
2. Create a few battle groups of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
3. 5,000 advanced combat aircraft are manufactured in various kinds.
4. Research and deployment of high-speed ICBMs with a range of more than 10,000 nautical miles will be accelerated.
5. Nuclear experiments resumed and military forces were established in space.
6) Retention of 1000 million tons of trinitrotoluene nuclear bombs and installation of nuclear warheads at the time of need for all short and middle-range missiles.
7 Retention of 30 strategic nuclear submarines capable of inflicting 3 devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy.
8) abandoning your commitment to not using nuclear weapons first.
9. Pre-emptive strikes are retained when there is a threat to national security.
My fellow Citizen is that if we are only confident and improved we can strive for strength. Qin Shi Huang unified China. Zheng Chenggong recovered Taiwan. We must carry on with our predecessors far and insight and strong will.
Now that piece of land is trembled far from the motherland's embrace, is shaking and calling, fellow citizens, carry forward what previous generals wish is unsatisfactory, moving forward courageously.
When I read history I simmered the heaviness and anger in my heart to my national concern. Although I was born to a cloth gown and was one of the common people, I was not regrettable even if I died, I was willing to serve our country voluntarily to be prosperous and splendid once again. Having shown my patriotic sincere heart to heaven.
I composed the poem here in a classical form of Ci to voice my heart's aspiration.
Paint a deep red lip.
Protect the Diaoyu Islands.
We bitterly lost our Ryukyu Islands.
How can we allow the Diaoyu Islands to fall into other countries?
100 years of vicissitude
The smoke and cloud chased a flying wave.
The youngest brother is still the tender youth.
wandered all directions and the seal was born.
Look over the flag.
We brandished our weapons and crossed the east.
Let the horses drink Pacific Ocean.

The other article is a book for Taiwanese compatriots I have a dream, the need to build a memorial museum or a temple for a Chinese national hero, how can we tolerate it, if China ever begs for the Olympics, if we forget about the hardships of history, only one country, one country, one country, one country, the state can decline when sport is overdeveloped, or the wealthy and the poor, or the disgusting ren Zhiqiang shut his filthy mouths.
Why don't we fight a little Japan?
What are the Chinese still being tolerated?
They even ride our heads.
Gut Chinese people still do this?
We should tell the whole world that others cannot bully China at will.
It's time we show strength. China is too calm.
Currently all our citizens' lives are too carefree. The officials are too extravagant.
Now we have no cohesion already. China needs to start a war. The faces of countries that follow the rear of the United States are slapped harshly.
Let them know that the US is not a panacea. If we win, it can increase China's influence. And improve citizen cohesion. If we lose, we can clean out the incompetent bureaucrats and make the trash out. Let China have new blood and update. Get China up.
Go China!
I would suggest that China strengthens its guarding of the Diaoyu Islands, daily guard the Diaoyu Islands, protect fishermen and our country's sovereignty. No matter the cost, we will fight a small scale war to defend ourselves. Japan dares to invade our territory with military force. China cannot lose.
We need shows in life, but showing yourself that someone embraces is really p.
I just passed by.
The whole society, including stars, is like this.
No sexy damned.
It's totally inacceptable.
It's just entertainers who are cheap. Their repute in feudal China makes somewhat sense.
Their lives look glorious.
a group of 9 professions
Life is hard.
Shocker.
That's normal, and a whore is heartless and the performers are always righteous.
They want money, they don't want the face.
Look at the wolf with glasses near Ms. Fan. You know if he isn't forced out or even framed, the actors have to drink.
son of a bitch
Okay as long as something eats and loveseats.
No one is easy to live like a show, you have to look at the scripts to know what the performance is.
All somebody.
The top score of the Imperial Examination is in all 360 walks of life. What an effort and effort is behind the top score of the Imperial Examination. This humiliates the bean vermicelli word.
hahaha
Overdoing.
Reality.
Shoot those hooligans.
cheap performers.
cheap performers.
The entertainment circle is dirty. All the men in it are birds, beasts, scum.
It's pity they are, but what's the blame. Those stars aren't easy.
Everybody does this. How can you make money without doing it?
When she was in front of other people she was proud, but when she stayed alone she was in a melancholy mood.
Nowadays, nowadays, the stars are just popular prostitutes, plain put, now that they are famous prostitutes, they should just be normal to drink or even sleep with some high officials.
Stop talking to other people. Just behave.
What should we be doing in the future, the ability alone is not enough to succeed, are we facing such a hard choice too?
Disputable is that more suffering is disguised as a glorious look.
It's not so bad because they just play out of their circle and out of mind.
But the old guy, Zhang Jizhong, who behaves hooliganically in his circle, also thinks he is untoldly virtuous. He makes a tv series when he has nothing to do to wreck the people of the whole country.
Both take what they need.
When can China have a pure innocent girl?
The story is now very shocking in the entertainment world. There are rumors that Hsu Yuki will be forced out because he refuses to drink with guests as arranged by the company, and he will have to switch to working with lawyers to make ends meet instead.
Super people with much envy often encounter social engagement or circumstances that they do not welcome but have to join in.
After all, they can't make a decision about many things because it has to do with many aspects and interests of many people.
Sometimes a very normal dinner party that seems like we ordinary people can't be that simple for stars like we imagine.
Star people have a lot of contracts and roll their money sources well to tackle. If she doesn't tack well, forcing out or even a frame will come to her heel.
Two kinds of smart star females. First those kinds always hold very high integrity and sternly reject all such invitations.
The second kind of person is good for playing the trick and achieving his objective with his seed money.
There is rumour that even some super female star will win her first role this way.
After drinking some alcohol, the advertiser or show sponsor may have a chance to lie on the star female's shoulder, feel her chin, or kiss her cheeks, and she will most likely adopt a endured attitude.
They are a very person in the lower 9 professions.
Actually, those star are just pretending and living a much better damned life than this.
It's just entertainers who are cheap. Their repute in feudal China makes somewhat sense.
Agreed.
Oh well, actors aren't easy.
They deserve it, they asked that.
Nothing is easy dawning on me.
Women are birds and beasts, men are worse than women.
braawwk.
braawwkkk
It doesn't take long.
The Route 288 opened late 040000 which ran around the southwest quadrant of the Richmond New Urban Region.
It has already changed the development pattern because it's getting worse and caused trafficking to congest around its exit.
Today, the Richmond Times - Dispatch told a tale of the impact on the Huguenot Trail in Powhatan County.
Will Jones reported that traffic on one section of the Huguenot Trail has more than doubled since the opening of 288.
Speed and accident surged as well.
So far this year there have been 17 accidents near the intersection of Winterfield Road, up from 12 in all of 2004.
Virginia Department of Transportation engineer and resident Dale Totten noted that if the Virginia Department had more money it would have 4 lanes of roads for about $11 million.
Of course VDOT does not have the money to construct roads in the Richmond region.
Because the VDOT spent all their frigging money with politicians and boostrs locally.
Where is Homer Simpson when you need him?
Oh doh this is a major moment.
As we predicted, Route 288 generated residence development in a scarcely populous area all around the exit and overtaxed local and country roads.
Other people chose where they worked and lived, but the highway with limited access could relieve traffic for those driving between Chesterfield County and Goochland County back and forth.
And they created a congest of trafficking in a new place.
I'm surprised that only this rapid is happening.
Even I think it could be a lag of three or four years.
Think about how liable it is if created for all its exits, since Route 288 already created a road construction at $1.3 million just at this one exit.
Another prediction.
The need for new roads to be improved a few more years after scatter subdivision development and approval of a mega-commerce project at 288 intersecting major roads.
Well before the decade is over we can see the unfunded liability zooming well past the 400 million dollars it took to build the original highway.
According to the brainiac who thinks Route 288 is such a great idea.
Thanks for nothing.
I think we can spend 400 million dollars better elsewhere.
I don't think you should blame the 288 for creating those people.
If they were enough to create a congest of trafficking in a new place, what would be the alternative?
Additional trafficking congests in old places?
Now you do understand how people like TMT in Fairfax feel.
I usually take a position in favor of the road.
But the 288 is definitely an excess with glaring need in other states.
Richmond has virtually no traffic.
The rush hour lasted 30 minutes.
And give them a beltway through a large rural area.
There is a road to nowhere.
Just think that this money could be spent on another Potomac crossing facility or on a road improvement that is desperately needed in NOVA.
Virginia Centrist: The rest of the state helped pay for 288 at the last budget deal, adding insults to injuries, wipes out the debt.
It would be very nice if you all had us.
It doesn't make much sense though.
The same problem is old.
If you get ahead of need, you are accused of causing sprawl.
Building in a place where there is already an acute need you can't pave your way out of congest.
Anonymous.
That's a fair point.
5:26 makes a good point.
However, this situation hammers home the state audit reports found to be valid for both the CTB and VDOT's transportation projects based on the best lobbyists rather than a comprehensive transportation plan.
I submit that this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated.
And Senator Chichester and his toady poured more money into this flawed institution, making this worse.
So what is the transportation expenditure?
In Virginia, it is for the benefit of a private business plan, not for the public interest.
You're all dead wrong.
No less than Walter Stoch stated the intent is to pay 288 dollars for economic development.
Come on folks.
I don't understand your point TMT.
When you're not from some sort of business, when will you stick to trafficking last?
It seems to me that the whole point of the road is to facilitate public interest in getting and from private businesses.
Of course, despite Sunday's drive, grandmother's trip to the location, and a soccer game, business support is overwhelming needed.
No wonder we are suffering from congest problems because our road expenditures do not match the increase in business or state domestic products.
If we recognize the road is the primary benefit to businesses then we should do two things.
Businesses pay more for our transportation bills (of course they pass) and incentivize them to locate themselves at the least stress of the system, even if that means more overall travel.
Why is it so hard to understand?
The solution is the functioning human settlement patterns and the balance of transport systems' capacity and the demand for travel generated by land use.
Spin all else.
EMR
TMT: "It's for the benefit of a private business plan and not for the public interest" in Virginia.
I don't see the point of this statement as it appears to demonize a private business plan and put public interests above all else.
I think they are tight intertwined so they are virtually the same.
The local problem obviously is because this cookie dough is lumpy.
But eventually, if we demonize business long enough, we will find all of us working for the devil in the aggregate.
I don't see how to claim a solution to the balance of the dynamic nature that has ever changed.
Even you see the Dulles railing as a positive one because it's a job center that promotes a bidirectional demand for rail.
I agree.
In fact, that can be all on its own sufficient reason to build it.
All I'm saying is that the exact same logic should be applied to the road.
To use our investments at the maximum, they should have destinations at both ends.
We need more places to get closer to the balance that you say we need more.
Check reality here.
I drove past Watkins Landing every morning and evening.
I commute back and forth on the Huguenot Trail from where I work.
I've never seen anything remotely like a trafficking flood.
It is zoned 55 miles/hr, where are the car's 75 to 100 in the morning?
The Huguenot Trail is already planned to widen due to heavy demand on the Chesterfield side, new schools, and a whole bunch of existing developments that have been zoned for years and have been funneled through Robious Road several years ago.
The 288 is wonderful for those of us who actually use it, rather than the lack of a road bottlenecking Powhatan and the west of Chesterfield.
We can develop in commerce and work closer to our living.
You might think that is irrational use of land.
I have no desire to live in any city.
I refuse to work in the downtown area.
I refuse to use a mass transit that is not safe for female commuters who work in non-regulative hours.
And I happen to like a large lot of development.
I don't understand exactly how I'm supposed to keep horses on a 1/4 acre lot.
One gallon of gas can go $10.
And I still pay for my living in the country.
Many people are legitimately preferring horse, hunting, gardens, small businesses of certain types, making them not wanting to live in urban cores.
This infatuation about living in a city truly baffles me.
Anonymous 6:37 You have every right to live in a country you wish to.
But you're not right that the rest of the state will underwrite construction of a $4 billion highway so it's easier to shop and get to work.
There are other things that have been consistently overlooked in the debate on the 288 road that could be spent 400 million dollars.
If money is applied to other press road projects or god forbid not even road projects, much congest of traffic will be alleviated.
Ray Hyde, my comments are directed at investors lobbying to place roads near property owners, and an incompetent system that funds this request regardless of whether it is linked to a master transport plan or not.
I'm 24 and my mother is 2.5.
I've broken up with my son's father since August.
I want to start dating other people and my son's father said he had nothing to do with him.
He is very possessive and very controlling, but he is not right because we are together.
Right now, in his life, too much goes on and he thinks we can work, although I have told him several times that I don't love him and he doesn't love me.
I want him there for his son, he doesn't need me too.
But he has no one. His family doesn't get along with him, and he and his family have an issue.
I don't want to be miserable anymore and if he's been around longer, I'll be miserable.
I don't want him there for his son because he's a good father or at least trying to.
I believe every child needs both parents, whether they are together or not.
But he thinks no one can have me if he can't.
What do I do when I move on to my life?
It would be very bad if your ex threatened you using your son.
You don't have to give that in because if you give that in, it just escalates.
You have the right to live your life and be happy, so don't cave because he's a threat.
If he really loves his son, he sees him, but this is just the typical control method that people like him use.
Other people say things like "I'll kill me if you leave me?" Is it going to get you through?

Meet all kinds of people.
Do what you want.
If he volunteered to walk out of your both lives, you would probably be better off having no one.
I agree. One other thing, his not his business is your date or not.
I didn't tell him.
Not because he's a threat, he's not about your personal life.
Can you document his threat?
You really need it.
quit taking his call and make him leave the voice mail.
Make him an email or text to you.
Keep that record.
Get a lawyer and divorce.
Try legal aid if you can't afford one.
Tell your ex that all communication needs to go through a lawyer.
The bus driver, the tiller and the delivery person of your food want an exact change.
Don't they realize you don't get a changed pile out of the bank?
Did someone have to take notes somewhere?

I like being as near as I can because I don't like counting copper all day.
Take a £20 note on the bus, they'll just tell you to get on the bus because they're hell lazy.

Hello, I started the University in September, but obviously not immediately gele like most people.
However, I know that it takes me some time to adjust, I am very introverted, shy and especially anxious the rest of the time.
All my housemates and I went out for the first night here, and it was the hardest thing I ever had to do.
When I sober I go to a Student Union bar on my own.
Here's the facts, but more to the point.
I don't enjoy university after about 5 months here. I'm disillusioned by the courses, I don't enjoy set projects, I don't like the courses much.
University makes it much better than it seems.
I started the first term badly; the financial delay for students adds to my stress level and I'm so worried I can't progress my work as all piles are concluded.
I was assigned a counsellor at university and I saw him for about 5-6 weeks in a blocked session and it didn't really work out because I never opened up to him, in my honest opinion.
It's only half the heart.
I'm loading work on my neck now, I have to hit major deadlines, I'm depressed and anxiously results in feeling miserable all the time.
I no longer have a counsellor, you can only have them in so many sessions at a time, and I doubt it will help me much this time if it doesn't already help me.
I'm a lack of motivation, don't feel comfortable with lecturers, I feel I want to give in, but I can't bring about giving in because I end up with jobs that end in death and aspire to someone.
I would rather die than be educated and live without the life I wanted to, and the matter would get worse when I dropped out of uni.
I'm 21 and will turn 22 this year and have not had much time left to fail if I have to do something.
Once I fail to college and do another course so I can get to university, I don't want to go over and over through the system and consistently fail.
Could someone give me some advice please?
Go and see your doctor if you can and see the way you can get your deadline extended to try and ease pressure a bit.
Send your tutor an email like this post and consider the mitigation circumstances. Don't worry, they've seen all of some of the admissions before, which is much more uncomfortable. I know because I'm using my work in the University administration.
Break what you work into a chunk you can manage.
Concentrate on one bit of the work at a time, obviously the most urgent assignment at a time.
Don't shut off your housemates and do well because you tried a new thing from the very beginning. Keep it now.
I recommend going to see your doctor too.
If you're always an anxious person, speaking to someone might be beneficial to you. My friend gets therapy from the NHS so it's really normal.
Try and get the deadline extended, if you're honest, I'm sure your university will allow it.
Keep strong and carry on life will get hard.
My Mum Divorcing She had horrible times with my step-father and her new freedom to find her was sending her round the bend.
She was epilepsy and a manic depression with a huge anger problem.
She is constantly horrible to me.
When I was at home, I couldn't cope with her outburst and nasty, hateful remarks.
I'm a 18-year-old who has 95% bursary and is full-time student in sixth form in private high-pressure schools at a break-point.
I can't work at home because she shouts at me.
Then I angered my teacher.
She was one minute lovely like I had my mummy back and then the next one will turn into the most spiteful human to live.
I haven't passed my A2 exam and I have already accepted that I was defeated and this year in my life has made me fail.
How many times can I come back from this? I'm most amazed at the university offers, but I can't even accept them. I've never made a grade.
I wish I could wipe her out of my life. Things were so much better without her.
But then I thought I was just selfish.
But surely this isn't to mean that my life is like it?
It should be so much better.
But I feel like I have no control over this downhill spiral.
And I don't know what to do.
Thanks for reading.
Nice vent.
You can't get her section because that's why.
Do she even have a history of mental illness or diagnosis?
Sure, you don't know you won't get a good grade so you can accept a place if you can.
Life will throw things at you all the time.
If there's not someone in your family, there's an outsider.
I had to deal with my dad verbal abuse 8 years before I came to university and honestly it was the only reason I was here.
If you really want out, you work hard.
Really sounds like you need support somewhere else if she can't give you support consistently.
Can you call Childline or something like that?
You can go to the library on Saturday and do a good 8 hour study at the library.
Can you go to your friend's house to form a study group?
You want her section because it's a bit of a pain in the arse and you blame it on all your problems?
I know how you feel.
My mum spits from hell too.
I highly recommend taking up smoking.
Oh, tsr grows up and stops nags. It's a joke.
I think I've become a much weaker person in the past two years and in a way, I've dulled down my personality to try to make friends with some people at university.
But being overly nice leads him to believe he can say or do whatever the hell he wants me.
They show absolutely no respect.
For example, I said hello to someone from a university and ignored me, but 30 minutes later they decided I wanted me to help some work and gave me that.
It has caused a lot of anger and distress in my life and really started to affect my concentration at university.
Has anyone got any experience handling this sort of thing or how to go about gaining some respect again?
Just say no.
If you're particularly uncomfortable about it, you'll do it gradually.
You might start sorry not busy but I'm busy.
Of course you don't go over the top with it to go in the completely opposite direction.
If you think no in your mind, say it.
When they start to realize that you don't bend over backwards for them, they start to respect you more.
Well this is really such a bad attitude, of course you can be respected if you're nice but not just letting them do anything for you. That's not nice but a fool.
I don't know if anyone has read this, but I just feel desperate and feel the need to tell someone.
I left home in September and started studying. I'm absolutely anxious about doing this, but I'm a delay in thinking about it until I get here. I'm here now and over 2 weeks here. I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel incompetent and social awkward.
Since I moved to secondary school, I have been struggling emotionally the majority of my life but I lost my dad around 9 and have always blamed it for my feelings. From December 2009 to around March of 2009 I had about 15 months of counselling during my life.
At the moment I feel like the incredulous problems in my life and making ever more doubtful about my always low self esteem. I often find myself very quiet on social occasions, and doubt about anything and everything.
I haven't been diagnosed with depression by the two counsellors and they suggest I'm not suffering from it, but it worries me hugely because of the depression that causes my dad to die and cause his suicide.
I tried to solve my problem before, I found exercise and meditation particularly useful, and also tried things like self help books and help tapes, but in general I felt this was my life thing, I wasted one chance of existence and one chance of being a young man, these feelings beat away at me.
I simply don't know what to do and have never followed through on what to do. My friend often says I'm lazy and I can't disagree a lot of times. I feel like people are trying everything anyone can do to help and I fail again and time and time again.
I'm sorry for anyone who has read this jumble mess and I feel a bit like a moan self seeking but I truly feel despair.
When people are in a new situation and feel pressured to socialize with strangers and fit into a new role (e.g. university students), things that exist have become more intense.
I'm not a health professional and can speak only from my personal experience so I strongly suggest you see qualified health professionals for your feelings and worries about depression.
Most people feel intelligent and awkward when they get to uni, so you definitely don't get alone at uni. But I should really get you an appointment for a counselling service at uni. It doesn't really matter if anyone tells you to be depressed or not. You obviously have some problems at a minute and you can use some support. The label is really helpful to meditate and exercise, so try to do it. It's not as important as you're experiencing. Meditation and exercise isn't
Good luck.
I think a lot more people feel the same way you do but medicate themselves using friends. Perhaps not as such, but when you get depressed you are definitely better than being alone and depressed. Either way, if you fancy a chat, feel free to send me a message.
If I were you I would be my focus on idols. If someone came out of a bad background and ended up being successful, happy, having a family, marrying etc. If you don't want them, but someone you admire and respect.
Focus on what you have achieved in life. You haven't stated what you have studied or indeed why. Because you want experience? Because your mum wants you to go. Because you need a degree for a career you want?
Either way, you sum up why you're there and work your bottom off to get the best grades, as you have something you can say when you get your degree (hey, I won't fail, it's hard and I won't work).

I hope this helps.
I'm pretty much not autistic, I don't have a dyspraxia diagnosis, I don't think the doctor is having a misdiagnose, but I've walked on my toe nearly all the time.
I'm more comfortable with it.
What makes them decide that walking on a toe signals autism because it seems so random and doesn't always indicate it?
Well, I can have signs of something on the autism spectrum, but who doesn't have one or two.
You guys know what I mean.
Walking on the toe may be an autism symptom.
headaches can be symptomatic of brain tumors.
Feeling a lot tired can be symptomatic of leukaemia.
The symptoms don't always apply but are worth a note, which is clearly asymptomatic in a lot of cases, in this instance, so never has been diagnosed with nothing to be noted.
I walked on my toe, but it was because I was born with a strange toe that had to be curled under and had to be straightened to surgery two years ago.
My brother was autistic but I didn't notice either, but the spectrum was so broad and I probably had mild Asperger's, so I had a communication problem and didn't pick up social reaction/body language.
But then I don't have a proper diagnosis and even have some symptoms, which doesn't mean you may have certain conditions.
I've been told not to walk on my toe for years, so I don't walk on my toe much.
I have dyspraxia.
So you can be dyspraxic or have a short tendon.
To find it more comfortable now, it's going to be drilled for people who do dance/gymnatics/ ballets etc.
I haven't read too much random symptoms like that.
Hello, I'm a 12-year-old girl who is 2 days old and is an addict of self harm.
When I was seven, I started slitting each individual finger with scissors, and never stopped from that day.
It's worse because I have my leg scarred because I slit it as a staple on my ex-boyfriend's name because I didn't stop the cuts if I bled.
I have several slits on my arms.
They were healed and then I cut myself from the staples I robbed of school.
I took around 5 paracetamols and other drugs and took them with lager and vodka when the cut was not found.
When I wrote this, I was really tempted to cut or burn my arms.
I'm an addict. I'll cut again when one heals.
I think it happens daily.
I'm 12 and my life is already sick.
This is the source of my dad leaving at 7 and doesn't want to know me anymore.
He just cares about his new little girl and wife and his new life where I don't want to be.
My best mate died when I was 10.
I have a relationship with a 16-year-old boy and forbid me from speaking to him because of events and age differences.
My mum also suffers from bipolar and I have depression.
I don't want to stop.
I don't care what to do to myself. I want to do it again and again to torture myself. I hate myself.
But I love my best mate a load, he means me the world, and if I did anything he would do it.
I didn't tell him but he found out.
I don't want to hurt him. I don't want him hurt.
What do I do?
Thanks for reading.
Are you on any drugs or are they getting any therapy?
You should talk to your school nurse or GP and tell them what is going on.
School teachers can be trusted people you can tell.
If you tell them, people can help you.
If you keep it in bottle, it will probably only get worse.
Trust me, this thing would be better to get it as early as possible, rather than let it get even worse.
Please don't do this.
I'm 17 and I started self harm last year (mainly my arms cut), but I stopped it a few months ago.
It's hard but you can.
I feel so much happier, but seeing scars remind me of how I felt at that time and felt so strong that I wanted such a thing done for myself, I am in pain.
And also strong. You can do it. I found salvation by writing poetry and keeping a journal.
Self harm is addictive, but you can overcome it.
Remember self harm does not define you as a person.
You can overcome it.
In the past year, I have always found my belongings checked to make sure I don't lose or leave behind anything especially when I go out to university, so I think I get a form of OCD.
I often have to check twice a go, then for some reason I can't resist checking again after 30 seconds.
Why is this?
I'm being crazed or something?
It's most often the most carried many but rarely, and I'm still checking many times a day even. To any extent is this an OCD disease?
What can I do about this?
I often get very anxious (which sort of goes away after 15-30 minutes) without checking, but it's much of an anxiety that causes me to not be able to wait that long.
I feel doomed if I lose my wallet or my phone.
I just wish I could go out every two minutes without worrying about leaving or losing something.
I don't really know what to do and I'm afraid to go to a GP.
They probably never heard of some compulsions like this and I just don't know what to do.
Do any of you have similar rituals?
People think I'm crazy, but it's very strange to get you out of this.
What could you advise me?
I used to do this on my way to college. I had a list of items I knew I had on my own and used compulsive checks on the bus.
Now I have more severe anxiety and I think this is a warning sign so you just try to wean on the habit when it's relatively fresh and definitely visit your doctor, but also tell you don't keep checking these things.
Don't worry about that because the doctor sees a much worse case.
What I do about OCD is an emoticon in the psychology class today.
avoiding compulsive action is just the way you can get rid of it so don't check if you've lost something and just leave it.
Despite the duration of your anxiety levels increasing, your OCD levels will gradually decrease, hopefully your OCD will disappear over time.
That just sounds over anxious to me instead of having really bad OCD.
I'm very obsessed when I get up every 20 nights to check my locks in all my houses in particular.
Sometimes I am convinced they aren't locked, but I know they are.
When your routine starts really being interrupted by obsess, I think it will become a real problem.
Don't worry, you're definitely not crazy, and I'm sure your GP understands the issue.
I went to therapy for other reasons also, and they encouraged me to pick, stick to and cut down on the obvious less than 20 numbers on my check.
I thought teaching was an idea and I would still be OK if I checked 5 times or 20 times.
I've been a lot better so far and I think anyone who wants to improve is definitely hopeful.
I'm usually pretty calm about things and would like to take them as they come and would not be worried too much.
But a month or two ago i found myself really anxious about things and i didn't talk about a mere feeling of nervousness from the blue.
I began feeling irrational panic over a variety of things that I didn't worry too much beforehand, and that didn't even cross my mind as something that caused the bells to ring alarms in my head.
I'm not sure if this is caused by a lifestyle change (go from a carefree student to an unemployed graduate) or by a non-employed person, but it has begun to bug me because it affects my confidence and happiness.
I speak of it to a few of my parents but all of them are the same people who think I've gone into a random phase and should hold off my actions until the serious problems are clear.
So wonder what is best to do?
You speak to the doctor about it and see if the anti-anxiety pill can take off the edge from what?
Can I see a speaking to a counsellor?
Or should I take the advice of the close people around me and just keep an eye on anxiety until it becomes a problem?
Well, I shouldn't start trying to keep my eye on your anxiety, it makes me tense and more likely to panic. There's a demise circle there.
As soon as you start feeling a bit panicky, I recommend trying to focus on something that will make you smile or feel happier.
If you can't do that, you get one of your friends to make a laugh or you can't do that. It works for me and I suffer a random panic attack lol.
It just starts to start really worrying about the tiny things, but not as severe as you are from the sound of things.
I find it helpful to just talk to someone else about what makes you anxious.
I find it in a moan way perhaps I'm not going to mention my mum what I'm worried about and see her reacting to the situation as calm as I should be reacting to, making me feel better about it.
But if it gets worse go to the doctor.
I have a friend who could suffer severe anxiety that he could prevent leaving the house and doing things because he was worried about how things could go wrong.
The doctor gave her medication and it made her much better.

The International Atomic Energy Agency reached an agreement with Iranian officials stating there are no remaining issues and no ambiguities regarding Iran's nuclear program and Iranian nuclear activities.
U.S. and European officials suspect masking efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce an atomic bomb from Iran's civilian nuclear energy program.
U.S. and European officials suspect masking efforts to obtain technology that could be used to produce an atomic bomb from Iran's civilian nuclear energy program.
U.S. and European officials could impose a fourth round of sanctions on Tehran when the U.N. Security Council considers the issue of Iran's nuclear energy program most likely in 070909.
Before the 35-member board of the IAEA meeting on 11 September 2007 the International Atomic Energy Agency distributed limited copies of the IAEA report.
The findings reflect an agreement between the Agency and Tehran on August 21, 2007 that Iranian officials began publicizing the week of 12 August 2007.
The accord said there remains no issue and no ambiguity regarding Iran's nuclear program and its nuclear activities.
According to Reuters news agency reports the IAEA report said there are significant steps forward in the work plan.
Reuters quoted a senior U.N. official as stating that the Iranian government's efforts to enrich uranium were slow.
The IAEA report stated that Iranian officials must continue to build confidence in the scope and nature of Iran's present and future nuclear programs.
On 30 August 2007 Iranian officials stated that they would cooperate with the IAEA so that further round of international sanctions could be prevented.
Iran's representative to the IAEA Ali Asghar SOLTANIEH stated to the Fars news agency in Tehran that the report emphasizes that there are no signs or evidence of diverting Iranian nuclear activities and that all Iranian nuclear material is audited.
Some non-proliferation experts stated the IAEA ceded too much to Iran.
In a criticism published the week of 19 August 2007 David Albright and Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security (IAEA) wrote that the idea of closing files violated fundamental safeguard principles and that the agreement did not specify the Iranian officials providing access to key people needed to verify the IAEA's answer to questions and documents.
Independent experts stated that Iran's latest agreement with the IAEA to access more nuclear sites and information was short of the West's demand to halt the production of concentrated uranium which could potentially be used as a bomb.
U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that Iranian officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program but the report could offer some new details or insights into Iran's program development.
Casey stated that the nuclear program will continue to move forward and shows that the Iranian regime will continue to defy the international community.
Most non-proliferation experts in the West stated that the 070821 agreement contained little that could dissuade policymakers in Washington, London, Paris and Berlin from moving forward another round of Security Council sanctions.
Experts stated that many transparency issues reported in the agreement on August 21, 2007 should have been resolved previously.
Executive Director of the unpartisan Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl G. Kimball stated that the agreement addresses the problem of the Iranian government pursuing enrichment technology and capabilities that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb materials.
Kimball stated that the Iranian government has designed to deflect criticism and pressure and claim that progress has been made.
Iranian officials stated reductions could be made through collaboration with inspectors with more sanctions.
The Security Council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on Iran despite restrictions on U.S. demands under pressure from China and Russia.
Soltanieh stated in an interview on Iranian state-controlled television that reports and measures made any other international organization including the Security Council irrelevant and unjustified intervention.

A document distributed to the Nuclear Suppliers Group outlines Israel's proposal to allow the transfer of nuclear technology to countries that have not signed on to non-proliferation rules.
The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win the exemption for India for engaging in nuclear trade.
Israeli officials convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt a new guidelines allowing the transfer of nuclear technology to countries that do not sign on non-proliferation rules.
Countries including India, Israel and Pakistan who have not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty prohibit participation in international nuclear trade including the purchase of reactors, uranium fuel or yellowcake.
A document outlined by Israel's proposal was distributed to 45 members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group in March 2007.
The Israeli presentation was made without a paper allowing for official denials.
A letter from NSG Chairman said on 17 March 2007 that an offer for an Israeli presentation was made in the context of the NSG's debate on Indian officials' bid for exemption.
India and Israel are only one of the nations that have not signed the treaty eligible to admit to the NSG under the proposal.
The Israeli plan offers 12 criteria for allowing trade with non-tealigated nuclear States.
One criterion indicates the status of Israel as a non-declared nuclear weapons state and says that States should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if Israel applies stringent physical protection, control measures and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons in Israel's territory, to all nuclear facilities and sources and special nuclear materials in Israel.
The documents were circulated at Capitol Hill in September 2007 as the Bush administration worked toward an agreement with Indian officials.
Executive Director of the Arms Control Association in Washington Daryl Kimball stated that Israel's documents could affect the debate on India.
Kimball stated --
The dynamic at the NSG is that the officials of the country don't want to be an obstacle to India being the largest country and the most powerful United States.
A consensus on India was difficult to reach at the NSG meeting in November 2007.
Israeli proposals give some countries officials reasons to suggest an alternative approach to specific exemptions.
Israel's record following international nuclear rule is good and better than India's.
The Bush administration rejected Israel's proposal despite the ties between the Bush administration and the U.S. government.
The proposal could complicate the Bush administration's efforts to win the exemption for India for engaging in nuclear trade.
President Bush and Foreign Secretary Condoleezza Rice view the pact as an important part of the administration's foreign policy legacy.
The deal was controversial in India and Congress had to give approval.
A victory in the approval of the Indian deal could negatively affect the administration's foreign policy legacy, with the most negative effect being an election year delay.
State Department spokesman Tom Casey stated that the U.S. government views the Indian deal unique and does not see it as a precedent for any other country including Israel.
Israeli embassy spokesman David Siegel stated that suggesting the Israeli government demands exemptions or linking efforts with any other issue including the Indian debate is gross inaccurate.
Seigel stated --
The Government of Israel has never asked the NSG to exempt for the nuclear supply guidelines or would never specifically request Israel.
Israel has been recognized as a full-fledged adherent of the NSG Guidelines.
The Government of Israel urged NSG to consider adopting a multi-tiered generic approach to transfer nuclear technology based on criteria.
Some NSG officials have previously suggested a similar approach to an Israeli plan.
Nuclear non-proliferation regimes will be considerably enhanced if the NSG Guidelines are modified in the line Israel officials propose.

Ahmadinejad announced expansion of Iran's uranium production capability.
Iran refuses to commit to halt expansion but hints that there may be a future halt.
Iranian President Mahmoud ahmadinejad stated to scholars in the northeastern city of Mashbad on 26 July 2008 that Iran has expanded its arsenal of enriched uranium-producing centrifuges to over 5,000.
Ahmadinejad stated that the expansion would be the first time since Iran's announcement of an approach in April 2008 to implement 6000 centrifuges.
Iran articulated a goal of 50000 centrifuges operating at an enrichment plant near the town of Natanz.
The international community demands that Iran halt the production of nuclear material.
The media report is different than the number of centrifuges cited by Ahmadinejad.
Iranian news agency reported that Ahmadinejad stated that Iran has 6000 working centrifuges but subsequently removed the statement from the Internet.
Another Iranian news agency stated that Ahmadinejad referred to hundreds of thousands of centrifuges.
Experts discount the significance of Ahmadinejad's claims because of absence of information on centrifuge functionality.
A diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity in Tehran stated that the number of centrifuges was less important than the operation and efficiency of machines but Ahmadinejad's assertions hindered the resolutions of a diplomatic standoff between Iran and the world.
Arm Control Expert at the New America Foundation Jeffrey G. Lewis stated that the New America Foundation realized Iran's goal of assembling 6000 centrifuges but that the status of the machines was unknown.
Diplomats and arms control experts stated that technical problems have hindered Iran's enrichment program.
Iran has repeatedly asserted that Iran's nuclear program is only aimed at producing electricity because nuclear weapons production is in contrast with Islamic principles.
The majority of Western arms control experts in the US, Israel and Europe believe Iran is pursuing the ability to produce a bomb that is decided immediately.
Experts stated that producing weapons-grade uranium is relatively simple to produce reactor grade material.
Ahmadinejad stated that after Iran resisted demanding that Iran halt its nuclear activities the West still pursued a resume of negotiations.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana recently presented 2 offers to Iran.
A package of incentives to cease production of enriched uranium approved by the US.
During the prenegotiation period of six weeks, Iran has not added centrifuges and the West has refrainted from promoting the UN Security Council's fourth round of economic sanctions.
US officials have repeatedly stated that negotiations could not begin before Iran's verified halt to all Iranian enrichment-related activities, but the Bush administration recently agreed to a proposed freeze for the freeze, dispatching Burns to Geneva.
On 26 July 2008 Iran refused to respond to Solana's offer during talks in Geneva attended by US undersecretary of State William J. Burns.
The talks constitute the highest level diplomatic contacts between the US and Iran in nearly 30 years.
Solana, Burns and the European envoy set the deadline for Iran's positive response before initiating new sanctions including the prohibition of the sale of a vital oil refinery product to Iran's economy.
Iranian officials refused to commit to stopping the expansion or observing the deadline.
On 26 July 2008 Ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that Iran could potentially halt expansion over 6 weeks at a higher centrifuge number than previously expected.
Ahmadinejad stated that if the number of existing and operational centrifuges is not increasing the West consents to 5000 to 6000 existing centrifuges.
If highly enriched, 5,000 centrifuges can produce nuclear material sufficient for power plants or atomic bombs.
6000 continuously run centrifuges could produce weapons-grade uranium for 6 months.
In May 2008 the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that Iran possesses 3500 operational centrifuges.

The diplomatic meeting in Paris concluded that no further steps have been taken to pressure Iran to halt uranium enrichment at the Iranian facility in Natanz.
Diplomats stated at a meeting in Paris on 13 November 2008 that officials from the United States, Europe, Russia and China had not further reached out to the media that they had agreed to act further to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment at the Natanz facility.
uranium enrichment is a highly technical process that can produce fuel for nuclear power plants and produce fissile materials for atomic weapons.
The meeting on November 13 2008 ended with no new measures announced.
After the meeting on 13 November 2008 the French Foreign Ministry released a statement declaring the international community reaffirming the importance of a dual-track approach to diplomatic engagement and sanctions work towards Iran.
Russia and China have resisted the new sanctions against Iran.
Russia and China have close political and business ties to Iran and do not feel domestic pressure to act against Iran.
The United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran have no close political and business ties and have felt domestic pressure to act against Iran.
Russia and China hold the power to veto the Security Council decision.
Russian diplomat Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by Moscow's news agency Interfax as stating that the parties did not strike a deal on sanctions against Iran at a meeting on 13 November 2008 and that Iran's sanctions were not a pro-western country but were not supported by China and Russia.
Sergei Ryabkov attended the meeting on November 13, 2008.
There is a significant report released this week that Iran is making significant progress at the research reactors of heavy water near Arak.
A heavy-water research reactor near Arak in Iran could eventually produce plutonium which could be used in nuclear weapons.
A satellite image published by the Institute for Science and International Security shows significant progress in the construction of a heavy-water research reactor near Arak between February 2008 and October 2008.
David Albright stated that Iran's heavy-water research reactor near Arak evaded the notice from the international security community.
David Albright stated that satellite images say that the Iranian heavy water research reactor near Arak is in significant progress and that the building frame has progressed to a large finish facility in the past 1.5 years.
David Albright is a former arms inspector and the director of the Washington D.C.-based Institute for Science and International Security.
Iran stated that Iran is pursuing nuclear technology to produce energy and conduct research.
The United States and its allies in the West suspect that Iran's efforts to produce would precede the creation of a nuclear weapons infrastructure.
Low grade uranium production is legal under international arms control regulations.
Iran's latest nuclear technology development has shown a complex diplomatic and technical challenge to take on the task of stopping Iran from mastering technology that could be used in manufacturing and delivering nuclear weapons.
Last month, when the United States President George W. Bush was in power, the administration managed to synchronize its policies with leaders of the European Union, Britain, France and Germany to press for tougher sanctions against Iran and diplomatic actions.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is expected to release a report next week criticizing Iran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency is the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency.
The new initiative on Iran's nuclear program did not emerge from talks in Paris on November 13, 2008 causing a decrease in hopes of imposing another set of UN Security Council sanctions before the end of President Bush's term.
During diplomatic maneuvers Iran continued to work toward mastering nuclear and missile technology.
Some Israeli officials stated that Iran's fire-fired a two-stage solid fuel rocket with a range of 1200 miles this week was alarming.
Tel Aviv is less than 650 miles from Iranian territory.

The Russian laboratory complex with high security and storage of anthrax, plague and other deadly bacterium faces losing electricity because of the lack of paying the electricity utility Mosenergo.
A large repository of deadly anthrax, plague and other bacterium that is stored in a Russian high-security laboratory complex 100 miles south of Moscow threatens to lose electricity.
A Moscow electricity utility official recently arrived in a Russian laboratory complex and threatened to turn off electricity because of a lack of pay.
The Russian laboratory complex is a campus of 90 buildings and serves as a location for a secret biological weapons program during the Soviet era.
The incorrect headline in Izvestia stated that the Moscow regional depository's deadly virus was a threat to the city.
There was no virus at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
There are every kind of bacterium killed at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology studying to use in the Soviet secret biological weapons program.
A large virus repository is located in Siberia.
Russian and Western officials stated that cutting off power at State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is unlikely to result in any threat to public health.
Russian and Western officials stated that there is no certainty enough that it is impossible to know why the loss of power at State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is a cause for public health threats.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology has quite a reliable emergency protection system.
General Nikolai N. Urakov is the director of the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology for a long time.
The State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology works with Western scientists to convert complexes into biomedical manufacturing sites.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology people are scared of this sudden shut down of electricity because of a kind of psychological pressure.
General Nikolai N. Urakov stated by telephone that if power is shut down at State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology scientists must destroy all the bacteriological experiments in a way.
General Nikolai N. Urakov liked how the United States and Western countries contribute about 6 million American dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapon complex each year to pay for the electric bill and arrears of the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
A close working American scientist at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology stated that the Russian government is responsible for paying its electric bill.
Western aid to convert the bioweapon laboratory of General Nikolai N. Urakov at one peak in 1997 as it was learned that Iran offered to purchase an expert from the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
Russia's scientists and military leaders now dependent on western finance to destroy nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have known to orchestrate a crisis to increase finance.
American scientists are working to convert the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk.
Beatty stated that this threat of cutting electricity at State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is a crisis.
Randall Lee Beatty is the Director of the International Science and Technology Center.
The International Science and Technology Center has approximately half the budget of General Nikolai N. Urakov for the support of about 350 Russian biowarfare scientists and technicians.
Randall Lee Beatty stated that it is known that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology has not paid its 14 month electricity bill.
Randall Lee Beatty stated that the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology is one of the world's most important archives for dangerous pathogens and that it was a shame to be destroyed because electricity utilities were not paid.
Approximately 3000 strains of bacterium have been stored at State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology and many of them are stored in cryogen casks cooled with liquid nitrogen isolated from the environment with layers of enclosures and oversized air handle systems that depend on electricity to function.
Defrosting the living germs currently in frozen States is the greatest danger of shutting down electric power at the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology.
Bio warfare expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies Raymond Zilinskas stated that the main threat to the organism is the cut of power to the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology rather than the threat that it could escape.
Raymond Zilinskas stated that the bacterium was defrost in the worst case and that the afterward cleaning up was really a mess because it is certainly not known if all the bacterium died.
Another example is that the Mosenergo electricity utility confronts the State Scientific Center of Applied Microbiology in Obolensk confronting the basic capitalism imperative of enterprises to sustain themselves with the old remnants of Soviet weapons science.
The overdue power bill in 2000 caused Russian National Power Company to cut off electricity at a strategic base where nuclear missiles stood on high alert.
Nuclear missile silo does not lose power.
Armed troops marched to substations and turned power back on.
National energy company United energy systems cut power in January 2001 in February 2001 in a number of military installations around Russia.
The military installation that lost power included a monitoring center for the Russian space forces in Kamchatka.
Electricity is quickly restored in most cases of military installations that cut off electricity.
Investigations often show the utility and military are tugging in war to force them to spend budget funds on electricity instead of diverting money to other uses.
Some of the budget cuts at times include building a residence in the country for the general.

Brazil has implemented laws allowing the Air Force to target drug traffickers in Brazil's airspace.
The US is concerned about the liability for the misidentification of civilian planes.
Brazil announced the Air Force had begun shooting down aircraft used to traffick illegal drugs in Brazil's airspace.
The plan requires 8 precaution steps before an order can be issued for the plane to be shot down.
The publicity campaign notified ranchers and others that they needed to file a flyplan prior to the policy taking effect late 041000.
The original law permitting such action was approved in 1998 but President Fernando Henrique Cardoso from 1995 to 2003 never put policy into effect.
The United States dissuaded Cardoso from signing the decree because it was concerned that the accidental downing of civilian aircraft could expose the country's government and companies to lawsuits.
In April 2001, when a Peruan jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed American and child-run missionaries, the United States reduced previous support for operations targeting drug-run aircraft.
The relative of the victim sued the US government and won the settlement because it provided intelligence and technical support in the operation.
A US State Department official stated that --
As a matter of certain, US laws can forbid assistance to countries implementing the shot down law.
The US agreed to assess Brazil's very serious and increasing threat from drug traffickers.
The US government and the Brazilian government will consult on Brazilian law provisions.
Brazilian Defense Minister Jose Viegas stated that Brazil encounters difficulties in obtaining support for the plan for the US but recent bilateral talks lead to certainty that the Brazilian government will accept the decree without exposing the US to commercial sanctions.
Brazilian officials expressed hopes that the US will endorse the policy before it goes into effect.
The US is scheduled to provide Brazil 10 million dollars in drug and law enforcement aid in 2004.
Former Air Force Chief and Director of the current Air Institute of the Estacio de Sa University in Rio de Janeiro, Mauro Jose Miranda Gandra, stated that the Government has taken courageous steps towards measures, but the impact could be more political than practical due to the Brazilian government's restrictions imposed on them.
Brazilian officials stated that policies could not be applied against children-boarded aircraft.
Viegas stated the limits were necessary.
Gandra stated that the provision undermines the essential purpose of the decree by granting immunity to drug smuggling aircraft carrying children and thus introducing the possibility of using kidnapped children as human shields.
Viegas stated in an interview in Brasilia that the government used laws more powerfully to dissuade drug traffickers who previously entered Brazilian airspace feeling no threat from the Air Force.
The government has been prompted by deteriorating public security situation regarding increasingly powerful drug gangs in Sao Paolo and particularly Rio de Janeiro.
The drug gang in Rio de Janeiro had more firepower than the police, successfully attacked the police station and forced business and schools to close.
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stated in a 2003 foreign correspondent interview that President.
The policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security.
Some pilots of drug-run aircraft feel so confident they are immune to retribution that they make obscene gestures to Brazilian Air Force pilots who are pursuing.
The question of the law is whether the law is constitutional under Brazil's prohibition of the death penalty as punishment for criminal acts.
Some legal experts and other commentators stated that the statute amounts to de facto executions for drug traffickers contrary to government claims.
The daily O Estado de Sao Paolo newspaper stated in an editorial the week of 18 July 2004 and 24 July 2004 that extreme measures raise ethical problems that exceed any potential benefit and juridical problems.
The penalty is applied extrajudicially in the Air Force commander's administrative decision.
These people gain over the crew members and non-regulative passengers the power to live and die.
In 2002 Brazil inaugurated a $14 billion dollar radar system called sIVAM that would allow the government to first monitor air activity throughout the expansive Amazon region.
The system uses US technology.
The illegal flights initially declined by 30% due to traffickers concerns about improved track capabilities but were reaccelerated later.
In 2003 Brazil recorded an unauthorised 4128 flights.
Some of these fly were innocent violations by ranchers flying between plants in the Amazon region.
Viegas stated that the deliberate violation of Brazilian airspace by drug smugglers who are aware of the government's inability to retaliate has increased significantly.
Rio de Janeiro's most notorious drug dealer, Fernandinho Beira-Mar, was captured in Colombia in a drug gun pipeline involving left wing guerrillas in April 2001.
The northwestern Brazilian Amazon corridor has become an increasingly busy and essential route in the global drug trade and is used to smuggle arms, gold and diamonds.
One of the most important routes to supply cocaine to Europe for drug and gun smuggling is reportedly running across the northern tier of the Amazon from Colombia to Suriname.
Colombia is the only country that currently has a policy of targeting drug traffickers.
Colombia is a source of much of cocaine and heroin sold in the United States.

Venezuela's weapons deals with Russia and the curbing of the military cooperation with the United States and planning to train as many as 200000 Russian civilians to repel the possible invasion of a superpower worry Venezuela and Russia's domestic critics.
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's weapons deal with Russia, curbs military cooperation and plans to train as many as 2000000 civilians to repel the possible invasion by imperialist superpowers, worry about the US and domestic military critics of Chavez.
Chavez insisted the move was pure defensive and bears the overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect Venezuela from nations who can want to take control of Venezuela.
Venezuela is the South American state that produces petroleum most.
Domestic opponents of Chavez scoffered the idea that the US would ever invade Venezuela and charged with truly intending to arm a huge cadre of loyalist reservists who protected him from any internal rise up and pose militarize counterweights to influence in Latin America.
Cuban leader Fidel Castro is a major ally of Chavez and has grown closer.
People in the US government who detract Chavez have said that even more trouble could be purchasing arms and indoctrinating civilian militias as part of a strategy to restructure Venezuelan democracy through the image of a militarize socialist socialist socialist in Cuba and foment the leftist revolution throughout South America.
The US military strategists said he was increasingly concerned about the potential foment of such a revolution by radical moves inspired by Chavez.
The political mainstream in Latin America has been shifting leftward since the late 1990s.
The perceived failures in free market economics are largely a reaction to this leftward shift.
The leftists were elected to be leaders of Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador and Venezuela.
People who support Chavez at home counter that the United States has a centuries-old history of open and covert intervention in Latin American domestic politics and said that Latin America has no right to question Venezuela's preparation for defense.
Carlos Roque Espinoza Leon said the Venezuelans never asked what the US marines would do.
Venezuela's national assembly is served by pro-Chavez Espinoza Leon in its defense specialization.
Espinoza said Peru has 500000 rifles and no one says anything.
Espinoza said no one complained about Colombia being the most militarized country in Latin America.
Espinoza said the history of the US is full of aggression in Latin America.
Espinoza said the Venezuelans must do whatever they need to protect Venezuela.
Chavez said famously that the so called Bolivarian Revolution was peaceful but armed.
Chavez was elected first in 1998 and his popularity has been rated 77% by independent polls by Datanalisis.
Venezuelan military analyst Alberto Garrido said in Russia, China and Iran that Chavez is looking for his allies to promote a multi-polar world against US dominance and encouraging grass-root moves in Latin America to throw influence from the government of the US.
Lorenzo Campos is a farmer in the state of Anzoategui in northern Venezuela and has been trained as a reservist.
Campos said the Venezuelans want the world to know they are not prepared to attack anyone and are protected by mission.
In May 2005, Chavez's government announced details of a 10-million dollar deal with a Russian firm to purchase 100000 AK-103 assault rifles each round of 30 ammunition, and technology transfer to Venezuela to manufacture the rifle.
The deal works out at $186.22 per rifle.
This price would have been considerably less expensive than $825 to $850 for the same weapons ordered in US mail.
The Government of Venezuela also intends to buy 10 helicopters from Russia, 10 Spanish transport planes and 6 navy craft from Russia.
Venezuelan officials said the government is negotiating with Brazil to buy around 24 air support and training planes.
Chavez insists and even the staunch retired military critics here agree that purchasing is essential to update the military's decades-old FAL rifles from Belgium.
retired General Fernando Ochoa Antich said it was exaggerating to say Chavez engaged in arms buildup.
Ochoa was a Defense Minister in 1992 when then lieutenant colonel Chavez launched a failed coup.
Ochoa stated that Venezuela had not purchased arms 25 years ago and said Chavez had not aggressively bought weapons under threat from his neighbor.
Ochoa said Venezuela never bought Russian arms before and suggested Chavez bought them to become independent of the US.
Ochoa asked why Chavez bought a rifle caliber popular with Latin American subverting forces and stated that his political support for a radical leftist move made him a continent menace.
The US Pentagon opened a question of what Chavez had done with the old FAL rifle and could share weapons or ammunition with the guerrilla forces in Latin America?
The US government has provided no evidence or funding for Chavez's arming or funding for the leftist insurgency.
The military analysts and specialists say the Colombian FARC guerrillas have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and don't interest old Belgian rifles or Chavez's assistance.
A 2003 study published by the US Defense Intelligence Agency reported to Venezuela that more than half of the weapons marked by the foreign military were originating from the weapons seized from Colombian guerrillas from 1998 to 2001.
implying that corrupt or sympathisers of the Venezuelan military can aid guerrillas.
The ideological training of the new military and civilian reservists, said by the critics, may be more distressing for domestic opponents of Chavez, according to the critics.
Earlier in 2005 Chavez called for a revolutionary unit to start preparing the public to resist the superpower aggressors and said it was the first step in training 100-200 million volunteers to back up active duty armed forces in the year to come.
Venezuela's active duty armed forces are estimated by military analysts at 83,000.
The people's defense units were created in neighborhoods, state companies, the Free University that was established under Chavez and were reported directly to the President.
The Government insists that the reserve supports armed forces and will not act as a fifth column against a possible coup against Chavez.
Espinoza said the reserve should not be used for troops that shocked any political party and that during Civil War each person decided his side.
General Julio Ramon Quintero Viloria is a reserve commander.
Quintero said in an interview that the armed forces hope to train 50000 civilians over the 20th weekend in the second half-time of 2005 and could in 2006 train 300000 more civilians.
Quintero said the Venezuelans don't want any colony of any empire and must be ready for any possibility.
In June 2005 100000 reservists and the Venezuelan navy were engaged in a massive war game to repel stronger invader countries.
In June 2005 40 state oil companies employees and 1200 soldiers participated in similar exercises.
The pro-Chavez circles here warn of nonsymmetrical warfare.
Non-symmetrical warfare is a term coined by US military strategists that describes non-equal combatants conflict where the weaker side employs guerrilla tactics.
In the past five years the US government has given Colombia 33 billion dollars in most military aid.
The loyalist Chavez fears the US government could instigate a proximal war between Colombia and Venezuela if it ousts him and controls Venezuela's oil.
In an interview a senior US official dismissed the notion that the United States government wanted to invade Venezuela as completely undeniable.
The official said that Mr. Chavez's side wishes to make a negative relationship as it calculated politically that Mr. Chavez had reached power by constantly confronting the US.
Another development in trouble for the United States is Chavez's rollback of military cooperation and joint exercises.
The US military has a Cooperation Office in the Venezuelan fort for 50 years.
Chavez shut it down in 040000.
5 US military trainers and students participating in exchange programs were ordered to leave the US in 050000.
Analysts say Chavez is likely to try to indoctrinate his public and armed forces.
Analysts say it has not proven that Chavez used that force to aid the leftist revolution elsewhere.

The North Korean government could be prepared to begin shutting down the plutonium-producing reactor in June 2007 and step first to disable it by December 2007.
On 18 June 2007 Assistant Foreign Secretary Christopher Hill stated that the North Korean government could prepare to begin the first shut down of the plutonium-producing reactor in June 2007 and steps to disable it by 12 December 2007.
Hill is the United States head of negotiations for North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
Hill stated that a stalled effort to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program could move ahead after a weekend of the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors on a visit to Pyongyang officials for talks about the verification and monitoring of the shut down.
Hill stated that the shut down is long anticipated following talks with Chinese negotiators Wu Dawei.
Hill stated that the shut down could last weeks but not months.
The Associated Press reported in Vienna, Austria that the IAEA stated that the team would visit Pyongyang the week of 24 June 2007 to discuss the manner in which the inspectors would verify the shut down.
Hill stated that IAEA inspectors held talks with Pyongyang officials about reactor seals including the installation of television monitors at the site.
North Korean officials refused to proceed with the agreement to begin decommissioning the Yongbyon reactor in 2007 until a 25 million dollar fund was transferred to North Korea in a linked account held in a Macao bank.
The money was frozen as an American official accused Banco Delta Asia of being a financial crime complicity on North Korea.
The funds were wired to the New York Federal Reserve Bank on June 14, 2007 after months of disagreement over the return method.
The funds are supposed to be sent to Russia's Central Bank before the transfer to a North Korean government controlled account at a Russian commercial bank.
Hill stated that the week of 17 June 2007 that disarmament negotiations from Russia, South Korea and Japan were talking about steps to recoup some of the lost time in financial transfer organizing.
The discussion also involved setting a timetable to resume the 6 nations' arms control talks.
Under the agreement reached in February 2007 North Korean officials pledged to shut down the Yongbyon reactor and allow inspections to verify and monitor the closure in return for 50000 tons of fuel oil being shipped.
In the next phase of the agreement, North Korean officials will declare all nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for further 950,000 tons of fuel oil.
Hill stated that the next phase of the agreement could be technically concluded by December 2007.

A leading arms control expert has criticized the new nuclear activity plans released by Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency of the U.N. for ineffectual and dangerousness.
Iran and the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency released a plan to resolve the issue by December 27, 2007.
The issue has not been resolved for 4 years.
The plan would allay suspicions of Iran's past nuclear activities.
The agency officials stated the plan was a breakthrough.
On 28 August 2007 Iranian President Mahmoud ahmadinejad stated at a news conference in Tehran --
The investigation into Iran's nuclear activities is now closed.
None of the other members of the International Atomic Energy Agency cooperated well as in Iran's cooperation.
Iran is a nuclear nation.
Iran has a nuclear fuel cycle.
Iran does not succumb to international pressure to curb its nuclear projects.
The purpose of Iran's nuclear project is a peaceful one.

Several Western governments and leading arms control experts stated that Iran made an attempt to avoid further U.N. Security Council sanctions.
Western governments include the United States and France.
The Iranian attempt was believed by the government and experts.
The arms control process was slow.
Answering the question of Iran violating the treaty in the past is inevitable.
President of the Institute for Science and International Security David Albright stated --
Iran's claims were unverifiable.
The International Atomic Energy Agency does not have access to people, documents and sites.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has lost its right to further questions in the future.
Unusual development sets a bad precedent.
The International Atomic Energy Agency might have been tricked because it was eager to the deal.
The International Atomic Energy Agency plan announced --
Iran has resolved the question of past plutonium experiment without explaining that.
Senior Fellow of the International Institute for Strategic Studies Mark Fitzpatrick stated that --
The International Atomic Energy Agency plan is superficial.
The International Atomic Energy Agency plan has drawn out negotiations for many months.
The International Atomic Energy Agency plan may leave Iran with incomplete and misleading answers.

The Nuclear Suppliers Group's list shows approximately 75 percent of Iran's purchase of nuclear-related materials has been denied since 1998 over suspicions that it could be used to build a bomb.
The 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group is an off-shoot of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and is in charge of monitoring international trade to ensure that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes is not directed at military use.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group is composed of technologically advanced countries.
The mission statement of the Nuclear Suppliers Group said the countries are acting on an individual basis to block trade that violates export controls devised to maintain cooperation in international peaceful nuclear energy use.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group does not have enforcement powers beyond notified companies of violating their guidelines.
The Nuclear Suppliers Group keeps the data private and meets in a large secret.
Most of the sales denials have been in place since 2002 and have resulted in intervention by members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
Diplomats from countries interested in exposing the extent of Iran's efforts to acquire so-called items which are dually used and can be converted into weapons production will avail themselves of a trade denial list.
The list is availed as long as diplomats and their countries are not identified.
The list names companies from Australia, Finland, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and Iran that are prevented from carrying out the deal because the items are suspected to be military useful in the sale.
List items offered for sale in a block deal include nickel powder, petrochemical plant components, compressors, furnaces, steel flanges and fittings, electron microscopes, radiometric ore sorting machine, laser valves and tubings, laser drilling rigs, mass spectroscopy and nitrogen production plants.
Iran's end-use organizations include the Iranian government, power and engineering companies, oil - refinery companies, gas companies, aircraft industry, schools, universities, engine manufacturers, mineral research centers and helicopter support.
Diplomats stated that the 75-denial denial represents only 7 of the 45 member states' actions.
Diplomats stated that the actual number of denials of sales of dual-use products to Iran is probably much higher than 75.
Western diplomats stated that the government in Tehran uses front companies without detection to receive and convert technology to weapons production as the standoff continues with Iran over Iran's nuclear program.
Iran has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but is not a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

Iran's Fars news agency stated that hackers known as XP had defaced or blocked hundreds of Shiite-related websites.
The blocked deface website included Iraq's official Shiite leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.
XP stated in a deface website that any website contained any material contrary to Sunni teaching was hacked.
Iraqi religious leader Shiite Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani's website was officially defaced and blocked from the sectarian-motivated cyber attacks on religious-related sites.
It wasn't clear whether the attacks began on September 18 or the morning of September 19, 2008.
Al-Sistani's website was offline the evening of 19 September 2008.
Another website related to one of Al-shia's religious organizations is also affected a href="http://www.al-shia.com/">al-shia.com/a>.
The alternative address www.sistani.com is still operational.
Iran's Fars News Agency stated that on 18 September 2008 and 19 September 2008 XP blocked access to approximately 300 Shiite-related sites.
The claims of hacking and Iran's assertion that the XP group is based in the United Arab Emirates can't be verified independently.
On 19 September 2008 several Iranian news sites stated that many of the attacks-related web sites related to Shiite and Iran normally ran again.
The statement signed by the XP was posted on Al-Sistani's home page and stated the attack was against Sunni Muslims.
According to the statement --
XP carried out similar attacks on other Shiite sites in the Persian Gulf and Iraq.
XP erased the site by doing with other Rafidha sites.
Rafidha means rejecter and is insulting used by Sunni extremists to describe Shiite.
Al-Sistani promoted sexual deviance and the Iranian agenda in Iraq as a bear in Iran.

The Somali pirates hijacked a Ukrainian freighter carrying a large cargo of arms and approached a deal to release the ship.
The question emerges regarding the shipment of arms along the route to Kenya and possible clandestine arms deals between South Sudan and South Sudan.
A maritime official and a person associated with the Somali pirates hijacking a Ukrainian freighter carrying large arms cargo on September 25, 2008 stated that pirates could soon collect their ransom.
After difficult negotiations likened by several involved in bazaar-style haggles, the parties were close to reaching a deal to pay millions for pirates and free shipping.
Ahmed Omar of Xarardheere in Somalia stated the pirates agreed with the ship owners with approximately 8 million U.S. dollars in ransoms and could be freed on 8 October 2008 or 9 October 2008.
Xarardheere is a notorious pirate base on Somalia's coast.
Kenyan maritime officials stated that there has yet to be an agreement on critical details.
One such detail involved a pirate's request for guarantees that the American warships currently encircled would not arrest or attack the pirates.
Kenyan maritime officials stated anonymously that such negotiations were complex and involved more than financial aspects.
The official stated on October 8, 2008 that progress was made and the parties approach to the agreement.
The pirates initially requested 35 million U.S. dollars and then reduced it to 200 million U.S. dollars.
The pirates have consistently expressed the willingness to negotiate with financial figures.
More than 25 ships were hijacked off Somalia's coast in 2008, typically ransoming between 1 and 2 million U.S. dollars.
A pirate boarding a Ukrainian ship stated that the ships, their cargo and 20 sailors were released upon receipt of payments of US dollars and preferring a $100 bill.
The question is the original destination, the arms shipment on board the Ukrainian ship.
Kenya's government claimed the weapons were sent to Kenya's military shortly after a freighter was hijacked on September 25, 2008.
The shipment will take place on the route to Kenya's main port Mombasa.
Weapons on board the ship included 33 T-72 tanks, 150 T-72 grenades launchers, 6 anti-avion guns and large quantities of ammunition.
Consequently evidence has emerged of weapons in a clandestine arms deal between Kenya and Southern Sudan's separatist region.
If the pirates did not hijack the ship and did not begin to speak to the media via satellite phone, the deal would most likely remain secret.
The Ukrainian officials are adamant in denying any wrongdoing.
Ukrainian diplomat Oleh Belokolos in Kenya stated --
The Government of South Sudan does not supply or have plans to supply any armaments.
All the appropriate paperwork has been validated.
Ukraine abided by all United Nations rules and arms control agreements.
Ukraine inherited an enormous stockpile of weaponry after the collapse of the Soviet Union and is now a major arms deal.
The deal with Ukraine is considered suspicious because Kenya is the most reliable supplier of heavy weapons to the United Kingdom and other Western countries.
Kenyan politicians demanded answers and called on several commissions to examine the situation.
South Sudan is an autonomous region that currently increases its military and uses Soviet-designed tanks.
The United States military stated it prioritized making sure the weapons were not unloaded and not sold to Islamic insurgents in Somalia.
The pirates denied their interest in weapons and claimed they were not aware of the fact that the cargo was one of the tanks that hijacked the ship.
In an interview last week pirate spokesman Sugule Ali stated that the money is the sole interest in the deal.

U.N. Drug Office head Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban have cut back poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing the insurgency.
U.N. Drug Office head Antonio Maria Costa said Afghanistan has produced so much opium in recent years that the Taliban have cut back poppy cultivation and stockpiled raw opium in an effort to support prices and preserve a major source of financing the insurgency.
Costa said this to reporters last week while the U.N. Drug Office was preparing to release its latest survey on Afghanistan's opium crops.
The survey showed poppy cultivation has retreated much in Afghanistan and concentrated in an overwhelming 7 provinces where the insurgency remains strong, mostly in the southern.
The survey was issued on November 27, 2008.
The United Nations found that a reduction in the amount of land devoted to opium in Afghanistan resulted in 19% of the total production tonnage dropping just 6%.
The study stated that the high output per acre is attributed to a good growing season in the south.
The southern region is heavily irrigated where the Taliban maintain a strong presence in the 5 provinces and systematicly encourage opium cultivation to finance their insurgency for several years.
The U.N. estimates that insurgents made much of the opium trade last year.
Costa said a lot of war effort could be funded by a lot of 2 to 3 billion dollars.
The Taliban produce an opium amount that far exceeds world demand for three successive bumper crop years.
Costa said the result was a glut that depressed a price drop approximately 20%.
Costa said the evidence that the Taliban, the drug lords and even some farmers are stockpiling opium is that the prices have not already collapsed.
An increasing amount has also been processed in Afghanistan.
Costa added that the insurgents held a significant amount of opium.
Costa said the surplus was as much as 11,000 tons (more than twice the world demand in the last 3 years) and threatened to devalue their stockpile.
The United Nations found Afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008.
The world demand is estimated to be about 4400 tons per year.
This year the Taliban stood passively in cultivation and placed less pressure on Afghan farmers to plant opium poppies.
This then supports current prices.
Costa is an Italian diplomat serving 6 years for the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.

The Citizen stated on 5 October 2001 that the South African Foreign Ministry announced that the South African Government had imposed a ban on mercenary activities following reports that 1000 Muslim military training people had enlisted in South Africa to leave Afghanistan to fight the United States for the Taliban.
The report claimed the Muslim Against Illegitimate Leaders claimed 1000 Muslim military trained men volunteerd their services and received local businessmen's backing.
The report claimed that over 18 years of military training, there were all 1000 Muslim men.

The Muslim Judicial Council refuted the report.
The South African Foreign Ministry stated that South Africa's " Foreign Military Assistance Act " prohibits recruitment of people inside or outside South Africa from mercenary or foreign military assistance.
The South African Foreign Military Assistance Act means that people are not allowed to offer military assistance to any State, organs, group or other country if the National Conventional Arms Control Committee grants permission.

On January 1, 2002 Peru's former spy chief during the government of ex-President Alberto Fujimori convicted of illegally taking control of the National Intelligence Service when he was supposed to only advise the spy agency.
Montesinos was sentenced to 9 years and 4 months in prison for abuse of authority.
The sentence also ordered that Montesinos be paid a $3 million fine for compensation to the state.
Anti-corruption judge Saul Pena stated that Montesinos admitted charges of abuse of authority.
This is the first ruling on more than 50 Montesinos charges including corruption, drug trafficking, illegal arms deals and human rights violations.
Montesinos is accused of running a bribe network.
The leak videotape showed Montesinos bribing congressman to switch to the government party and triggered events that culminated in Fujimori's resignation in November 2000.
Fujimori was accused of duty dereliction and embezzlement and has been exiled in Japan since his resignation in order to avoid legal action by Peruan authorities under dual nationality protection.
Montesinos fled Peru in October 2000 but was captured in Venezuela on 23 June 2001.
Montesinos heard the sentence at Callao Naval Base where he has been in prison since 2001.
Montesinos stated that he would consult defense lawyers in his appeal.

Hong Kong police are trying to prevent Triad or transnational criminal syndicates from engaging in criminal activities.
Hong Kong police recently smashed transnational stealing syndicates specializing in exploiting youngsters to commit various crimes, cross-border criminal syndicates, and local gangs of Triad.
The Oriental Daily News article stated that within a short period of 3 weeks, the Hong Kong police's recent efforts to cut down on 5 of the so-called leaders of the Triad branch or the district team.
Hong Kong police recently worked closely with the Public Security Bureau of Guangdong for intelligence exchange and carried out raids and operations of the series.
Hong Kong police crackdown on Triad's activities including drug trafficking, illegal arms possession, theft, burglary, robbery, sales of pirate and obscene records and mandatory cigarettes and dangerous drugs trafficking.
Police dispatched over 100 staff on 020724 to storm a propitiate dance and wine party organized to settle some dispute between the two Triad groups at a disco nightclub in Mongkok, Kowloon.
The police eventually arrested three branch leaders and 14 Triad core members.
On 25 July 2002 police sources confirmed to Xinhua News Agency that all 17 people arrested were still detained in question.
The Hong Kong police source quoted the fact that the operation successfully netted all 17 people resulting in efforts to infiltrate relevant gangs here.
Police sources also intimated that the Hong Kong police have taken more crackdowns against other Triad gangs.
Police in Hong Kong have been involved in active cooperation with Chinese mainland and other regions in efforts to fight off criminal organizers.
The first such target-call conference of the International Drug Enforcement Conference in the Far East was held in Hong Kong earlier in July 2002.
Hong Kong was chosen to host the event following the IDEC decision at the meeting held in Bolivia in February 2002.
Some 42 anti-narcotics officers from mainland China, Hong Kong, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United States met as senior officers.
The Hong Kong police's internal news letter recently reported that the conference aims to provide a flexible and forward thinking environment for sharing information and positive actions against organized criminal drug traffickers.
In particular, the exchange of intelligence between Hong Kong police and police on mainland China was intense.
A delegation of 11 members of mainland China's National Narcotics Control Commission recently visited Hong Kong to study how police here enforced their anti-narcotics laws.
Chen Cunyi, Deputy Director of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security's Bureau of Narcotics Control, chaired the team of 11, and was briefed by Hong Kong police on enforcement actions carried out in Hong Kong, and led by head of the Chinese Narcotics Bureau, Ip Lau Chuen.
Hong Kong police also exchanged mutual concerns with China's National Narcotics Control Commission and discussed a number of issues including investigations into anti-drug trafficking and money laundering activities.
The mainland parties closed their visit after meeting with Deputy Crime Commissioner of Hong Kong Yam Tat Wing and discussed further proposals for cooperation in combating cross-border drug trafficking activities.

Peruan military documents disclosed links between former intelligence head Montesinos and drug trafficking.
A document disclosed on 25 July 2002 signed by a former Peruan army high-ranking officer mentions the links between drug trafficking and could further compromise the situation of Peru's former National Intelligence Service head Vladimiro Montesinos.
According to the front page story of Peru's El Comercio daily national newspaper, Montesinos could authorize a drug deal between leaders of the Alto Huallaga military group to find leaders of the Shinning Path rebel group and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
Alto Huallaga is located in the northeastern Lima capital.
The story is based on the final Attorney General's Office report.
The Attorney General's Office report collected the accused documents handed over by unnamed Peruan army generals.
El Comercio said the 920000 Scorpion intelligence operation was put into effect by the then president Alberto Fujimori to fight off terrorism and drug trafficking in Amazon.
Several agents infiltrated the group including the planned Scorpion to gather information about the commanders of main rebels and drug trafficking.
